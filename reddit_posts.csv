Will DJT shit the bed next week? Full DD with updated regard speculative theory on Trump selling,"Before this adderall-fueled hype train leaves the station next week, I thought i'd write up a definitive DD on the imminent DWAC/DJT merger.

This DD will cover everything: fundamentals, Truth Social, ownership, dilution, Trump's holdings and lockup, the future of TMTG, regarded theories and more. You may have seen my [original comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bkvr48/comment/kw10fel/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) (that was stolen and reposted) with a regarded theory about Trump selling shares - **if you can't be bothered to read the full DD, then skip to the end for an updated regard theory of Trump potentially selling shares - now with new information and speculation!**

Before I begin, a quick shoutout to the legend that is u/SPAC_Time. This guy is probably the most knowledgeable person about SPACs i've ever seen, and has been posting excellent information over on r/DWAC_Uncensored, a lot of which is included in this DD. I strongly recommend going and having a look at this sub as it has SO much great information on it. There's loads on there that i've not included in this DD. He's also patiently answered all my questions, so thank you king.

I've been following this since the beginning, and even made an account on Truth Social to see what the bulls are thinking. Honestly some of the shit they come out with over there make the regards on this sub seem like fucking Albert Einstein.

I'll also preface this by saying I have a terrible trading record, mostly crippling losses, so obviously none of this is financial advice and you should ignore everything I say. If anything is incorrect drop a comment below and i'll fix it.

# Overview

You probably already know what this is about, so I won't go into to much detail. Back in 2021, Trump started his own company, TMTG (Trump Media and Technology Group), which owns the social media network Truth Social. It wasn't actually Trump's idea, it was pitched to him, more on this later. The aim is to bring this to the public markets via a SPAC merger with DWAC (Digital World Acquisition Corp). Yesterday shareholders approved the merger, and it's set to complete this merge next week. DWAC has been trading publicly for a few years now, soon the ticker will change to DJT when the merger is finalised.

Before I get into the finer details, here's a quick TL;DR of the bull and bear points for those who will look at this post and say ""i'm not reading all that""

# Bullish

* Trump is a hype machine.
* Something something woke mind virus and free speech
* Truth Social is a soapbox for Trump, and everyone listens to what he says.
* The run-up to the election will generate a lot of hype.
* If Trump wins the election, DJT could trade on hype for a long time
* In theory, if he does win the election, TMTG could become significantly more relevant, leading to an improvement in its fundamentals.
* If the above happens, it's possible TMTG could bring to market their other proposed ventures - a news network and competitor to the existing streaming services.

# Bearish

* The fundamentals are pure dogshit
* If Trump loses the election, it's all over, TMTG will probably go bankrupt.
* Trump could potentially sell shares around the time of the merger.
* DJT will be propped up by just hype, not adequate shareholder equity, which is volatile and unstable.
* The dilution could cause a significant drop in share price if there isn't enough hype to offset it.
* Trump is a serial grifter who's failed at many businesses in the past and screwed over countless customers, investors, suppliers and more.
* SPACs have had a terrible track record in recent years, espeically those with poor fundamantals.
* SPACs are a cheap way to go to market, with the shareholders bearing the cost of this.
* TMTG has no path to profitability in the forseable future. It has not provided any updated business plans, future growth estimates, guidance or updated revenue projections.
* The other proposed ventures (news network, streaming service) are extremely expensive to get going, we're talking hundreds of millions, even billions of dollars just to get off the ground. As i'll explain later, TMTG *could* have gained the cash to do this through the merger, but unwound it, making these ventures completely unfeasible with the cash DJT will get in this merger.

Right lets get into the details.

# Truth Social

Currently, Truth Social is the only revenue stream that TMTG has. I don't know if you've been on there at all but it's basically a hive-mind echo chamber of Trump worship.

There's basically 3 types of users:

* MAGA cult
* Bots shilling ED pills and fake gold coins.
* A small number of anti-Trump trolls, posting on every truth Trump does.

I am of the opinion that Truth Social is a completely flawed concept. The concept is that Trump is trying to make a social media network, or ""big tent"", that will be a town-square that is used by everyone - Republicans, Democrats, independents, everyone.

In reality, Truth Social is a social media network hashed together from open source code to spread one-sided propaganda of a presidential candidate. Right off the bat it's a one-sided Trumpfest, and does not make any effort to include anyone other than MAGA.

If Hillary Clinton made a social media network, do you think MAGA would join it? They absolutely wouldn't and this question just highlights their flawed thinking.

You can say what you want about the one-sided nature that the legacy social media networks like Twitter became, but they weren't set up by a political candidate solely to give them a soapbox.

There's also nearly no unique IP behind Truth Social. It's an open-source platform with no unique features. Other than (currently) the only way to hear Trump's thoughts as he takes a shit, it's worthless. It doesn't even live up to it's ""free speech"" claims, as they regularly ban people for arbitrary reasons.

# Fundamentals

Unsurprisingly, the fundamentals of this company are absolute dogshit. This company makes barely any revenue, and has losses in the tens of millions. I can't see how this is going to get any better after merger, and they'll have an $18m SEC fine to pay.

From the balance sheet from the latest revision of the S4 in February:

For the 9 months ended September 30 2023, TMTG made about $3.2m, with an operating loss on that is about $10m.

TMTG claimed that in it's current financial year it projects to make about $17m in revenue, although I can't see how this projection wold be accurate. There's not been any meaningful uptick in users on Truth Social, major advertisers still avoid advertising there, and the other alleged revenue streams that they proposed early on (like a news network and streaming competitor) haven't come to fruition.

# There's barely any cash backing shares of DJT

The shareholder equity of DJT after the merger will be painfully low. After the merger completes, DJT will have access to the money in the trust. This money is essentially the money that DWAC sold the original DWAC shares for when it initially entered the market before it found an acquisition target (TMTG) - about 30m shares at $10/share - so the trust has approximately $300 million in it.

After the merger, DJT will have to pay an $18m fine to the SEC as a result of the investigation which concluded last year.

Ignore the current market value of DWAC shares for a moment. Let's look at how much cash is actually backing each share. Doing a rudimentary calculation (because we don't know exactly how much money DJT will actually get from the trust, or the in-depth liabilities TMTG has): Lets say we take the full value of the $300m trust, minus the SEC fine, and the actual cash backing each share of DJT will be approximately $2.08 per share. This value could be even lower, as legal fees and other operational expenses (like DWAC expenses, and potentially costs of their lawsuits) need to be subtracted from the trust on merger before the cash is released to DJT.

This low cash backing for each share is very low, it's even very low for a SPAC. In the last four years, the average cash backing per share after merge of all SPACs was about $6.67.

Normally, SPACs obtain PIPE (Private Equity in Public Entity) investment during the merger process to offset low cash per share after merge. They specifically do this to ensure the SPAC can meet its operational obligations, and pay all the required costs to bring the merger to market.

DWAC did have a $1.3b PIPE deal set up. This would have given the company an absolute shit ton of money, enough to fund operations for years, and fuel expansion and growth. It would have meant that each share of DJT would have been worth approximately $11.80 - pretty solid cash backing for a SPAC.

However, they completely unwound this PIPE investment. My guess is because they didn't want the extreme dilution that the PIPE would have caused. The PIPE shares were not under lockup, and PIPE investors could have sold immediately on market open after the merger, destroying the share price. They were given a good deal on the shares (it was a percentage below current market value), so likely would have sold for an immediate profit. Remember this part because it works into my regarded theory later on. Spoiler alert: They weren't protecting the retail shareholders by doing this.

# Ownership and dilution - what about the 1 billion shares?

Currently, DWAC is mostly owned by retail. These retail shareholders are somewhat unlike ""normal"" retail shareholders in that they are insanely dedicated. Many of the estimated 400,000 retail shareholders in this will not sell for any reason. Trump could literally dump shit in their faces and they'd probably take it and hold their shares. You could say that this retail holding is stronger than in the average company

After the merger this will all change.

Currently the float of DWAC is about 30m shares.

After the merger, the DJT float will swell to about 135m shares. The majority of these shares will be owned by Trump, currently under lockup for 6 months (more on this later).

There's been lots of talk about 1 billion shares being dumped into the float after merger. This has even been widely circulated in the press, but it's incorrect.

DWAC have authorised 1 billion shares, it hasn't issued them. This means that in the future, DJT could potentially issue up to 1 billion more shares without having to conduct a shareholder vote or amend the company charter. It's like 1 billion reserve shares sat there if they need it.

It's actually a pretty common thing to do with IPOs and SPACs, many companies authorise shares to be issued later on to raise funds etc.

In any case, if they did issue more shares from this 1 billion amount, it wouldn't be until way after the merger.

There will, however, be significant dilution on merge. On business completion, up to 8,369,509 shares will be dumped into the float, given to holders of TMTG convertible notes. These shares will not be locked up like other insider shares, and can be sold immediately after merge. The holders of these notes will likely do this because they'll immediately realise a 400%+ gain. This is significant dilution, and could cause a huge drop in share price, unless insane Trump mania causes a hype rally to offset it. Much of the rest of the float is potentially (foreshadowing here) locked up, but this 8m share dump is significant.

# Trump hype

The hype surrounding trump is real. We've seen it many times before with DWAC - the insane rally to $175/share was surreal. It's plummet after was equally unreal.

The hype has the potential to offset everything - shitty fundamentals, insane dilution and more. It's the reason DWAC has traded so far away from reality in terms of an accurate valuation.

I'm sure you all saw this post about the hype, that led to you all pumping up the price of the OP's contracts by like 800% before he sold most of them:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bikpfj/these\_calls\_could\_be\_500\_baggers\_turn\_1000\_into/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bikpfj/these_calls_could_be_500_baggers_turn_1000_into/)

The first takeaway from the above DD is that the hype is fucking insane, and supersedes everything, can cause the share price to rocket to the moon regardless of anything else.

I agree with this. It's possible that there will be a huge buying demand to offset the dilution on merge. DJT could rally to the fucking moon.

The other is the theory that Trump will shill DJT and all his MAGA cult will all rush to buy in.

This theory i'm not convinced on. Much of his cult have no idea how to trade shares, many of them are braindead and can barely read. And if you think that they'd buy shares anyway, think about this:

Trump has literally been on-stage at rallies in front of tens of thousands of his most die-hard supporters, and directly shilled Truth Social to them and they *still* haven't rushed to join. And Truth Social is a zero-barrier, free to use social media network specifically set up for them.

I personally don't think we'll see millions of MAGA pouring into the market to buy DJT. Any MAGA who already know how to trade will be holding shares of DWAC already.

# Regarded Trump selling theory - now with updates!

Now it's time for the juicy stuff - the regarded speculative theory on Trump selling shares.

Disclaimer: This is a regarded theory that probably won't happen, obviously i'm jumping to conclusions not necessarily found in hard evidence. If it does happen, though, I expect to be awarded a flair from the mods.

It's widely understood that Trump has a lockup on his shares for six months after the merger.

There is, however, a clause that undermines this.

In the [latest revision of the S4](https://app.quotemedia.com/data/downloadFiling?webmasterId=90423&ref=318071075&type=HTML&symbol=DWAC&cdn=7df8a564ed5159633ce6abd5829662e5&companyName=Digital+World+Acquisition+Corp.&formType=S-4%2FA&formDescription=%5BAmend%5D+Registration+of+securities%2C+business+combinations&dateFiled=2024-02-14), filed in February, on page 42, it reads:

>Lock-Up. **Unless waived by Digital World prior to the Closing**, key stockholders of TMTG (including its management team) agreed to be subject to a six-month lockup in respect of their Digital World common stock, subject to certain customary exceptions, which would provide important stability to the leadership and governance of TMTG.

This means that, at any time before the merger closes, DWAC could waive Trump's lockup for some or all of his shares. Further to this, they could do it before it was disclosed publicly. In addition to this, Trump could sell shares for several days before DJT issued it's first 8K approximately 4 days after the merger.

As mentioned in my previous comments, I theorise that Trump could potentially dump some or maybe even all of his shares, potentially even destroying the company and allowing him to walk away with billions. He could then just go back to X to continue to be able to reach an audience far bigger than on TS.

Remember when Trump met with Elon earlier this month, and everyone thought it was to do with Elon donating to Trump's campaign? Wrong. I theorise that they were doing a mutually-beneficial deal:

Elon agrees to ensure Trump never gets banned from X under any circumstances, ensuring he always has a soapbox.

Trump agrees to return to X, giving Elon a huge bump in viewers.

Trump dumps a load of his shares, pays his legal bills, makes a shit ton of money, gets a much bigger audience on X compared to Truth Social. It's a win win for both of them.

**Additionally, I theorise that DWAC unwound the PIPE deal not for retail shareholder benefit, but to avoid Trump's shares from dropping in value so he could sell them at a higher price after merge. DWAC never issued a reason publicly as to why they unwound the PIPE. Unwinding the PIPE is seriously detrimental to the core of the business itself. It means significantly less cash to fund operations for a company that makes yearly losses in the tens of millions with no path to profitability.**

The company will get under $300m of cash, rather than nearly $1.6bn it would have gotten with the PIPE deal + initial $300m share offering by DWAC. I'm yet to hear a reasonable explination as to why DWAC would unwind the PIPE.

The counters to the above tin-foil hat theory are:

""But Trump wouldn't need to sell, he could just borrow against his shares""

I'm not convinced about this for several reasons. Firstly, what sane lender is going to lend up shares that are under lockup for 6 months. They wouldn't be able to force Trump to sell his shares to repay the debt for up to 6 months if he defaulted on the loan. Secondly, TMTG is basically worthless, with barely any shareholder equity as described above...his shares aren't worth anything and have barely any cash backing them. Lenders will want solid fundamentals before lending against shares, they aren't gonna lend him half a billion $ on shares that are propped up on hype.

[Reuters is also reporting](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/investors-greenlight-trumps-6-billion-social-media-deal-2024-03-22/) that he can't borrow against them due to previous terms he's agreed to:

>It is unclear how and when these cases will be resolved. Even if the  deal gets completed next week, Trump will not be allowed to sell any of  his shares in the combined company for six months **or borrow against them**, based on terms he previously agreed.

""The board wouldn't allow it""

Go look at who the board of DJT is made up of: Trump, his sons and some of his closest yes-men. He basically controls the board. The DWAC board is made up of Trump yes-men as well. The fucking SEC investigation was specifically about how Trump colluded with DWAC without disclosing it publicly.

""Why would Trump destroy his own company?""

Because said company is basically worthless. It has a high share price now based on hype, but it's going to take A LOT of work to get it generating revenue and profit. When the hype dies down, the share price could plummet, reducing hes unrealised net worth. If he loses the election it's all over, and if he hasn't sold by that point he'd lose BILLIONS. Institutional investors won't be touching this, so there won't be a solid foundation of ownership.

Trump looks out for himself, and he's backed into a corner.

""But he's screwing over his base""

Obviously there's a risk here, in that dumping his shares on his cult could cause a significant backlash, and he needs every vote he can get going into an election. However current DWAC shareholders are a tiny percentage of his base. If he dumped his shares on them, the majority of his base probably wouldn't even know about it. I'm not even convinced they'd turn on him either, they are literally in a cult. Remember when he said this back in 2016: ""I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn't lose any voters, OK?"". Still rings true today.

Trump is desperate. NY is about to start seizing his assets, potentially within days. I can't imagine him choosing TMTG over Trump Tower for example, especially when he could potentially liquidate his entire holding of TMTG for an immediate gain of several billion cash.

# What's going to happen after merger?

Honestly...who fucking knows. It could absolutely shit the bed due to dilution even if Trump doesn't sell shares.

Or the hype of Trump could propel the share price into the stratosphere.

EDIT: Forgot to add in the next step which will be the ticker changing from DWAC to DJT. The earliest this could happen is Monday. However an actual date hasn't been announced yet, so it could be Tuesday or Wednesday, or even later towards the end of the week.

I could, and probably will be, wrong about all of this. Be sensible and don't trade this merger.

Have fun regards.

Soundhound,"I am fully invested at 8.11 cost basis with a total of 13000 shares.  Not worried by any means. If you play the stock market you always know that there are going to be ups and downs.  

Companies such as Soun that start to gain momentum especially this early in the ai boom will always lose traction due to short sellers that lose large amounts of money when things aren’t going their way. 

This is why last week short selling bombarded the news so that the bears could make back the money they lost.  It’s a push and pull sort of thing.  On top of making their money back they are pushing the stock to its lowest point to then hop on the train as it starts to go back up to make even more money. 

Reports of the ceo and coo selling shares was made to satisfy tax withholding obligations related to the vesting of restricted stock units. Of course they don’t mention this when they put out these reports because this helps them short the stock even more. 

If you’re a day trader trying to make money obviously this may have threw you for a loop and the panic selling began.  

Here is the proof in the pudding that I am fully invested and am not worried one bit.  If and when it goes down more I would encourage more people to buy if they already haven’t.

APPLE AI/TECH GAME PLAN ,"Hi, I want to know what you guys think about this idea on Apple. Let me know. 

Apple has become one of the most successful companies of all time. They were the innovators of the past but and not really pushing the boundaries like NVDIA. This is a good thing for Apple and what I believe to be their plan. 

1. Monopoly’s run shit in America. companies that have established themselves as economic powerhouses continue to take over and consume industries. It’s possible that Apple could be waiting to buy their way into the AI/TECH boom instead of trying to innovate further. 

2. APPLE has a massive cash pile and it’s been  growing just as soon as the AI/TECH boom started. This allows Apple to have options when it comes to their next move in the industry.

3. Growing cash pile isn’t good for now. From what I’ve see a growing cash pile means the stock for Apple has underperformed. But as soon as we see Apple start to put that money to use which we have not seen yet it just allows investors stock up on shares. 

4. Apple could simply buy their way into the industry and become a top dog again because they have enough money and resources to either buy a company that already has experience with the new age of tech. Or Apple could start to dump money into something new and impactful since they already have more than enough capital and resources to pull it off.

What’s my plan?
I plan on waiting for that cash pile to keep stacking high and as soon as I see significant decreases I will dump money into shares and wait a year or buy leaps.

Was Josh Brown Right or Wrong about Nvidia? 😂,"
Does anyone remember this beautiful moment? First, let me be clear. I love The Compound and Friends Podcast. So much so that I started a Reddit community. However, I have to be completely honest about what I witnessed in February. 

During the early stages of Nvidia’s bull run, Josh came out on CNBC and said he trimmed his position by 20%. I was shocked! I thought to myself, this thing hasn’t even warmed up yet. Looking back, I think I made the right move to hold….BUT, alternatively, does anyone think Josh was right?  

What say the people?

CR-AAPL is a BUY. The AI bull market is only beginning.,"Fiends and family across the globe,

Last week I was beginning to believe we were about to enter a correction. I was mistaken. The markets are instead primed for an ""erection"".

Why? Well, for one I've been watching AAPL quite closely recently. The shadow puppeteers of the market threw out some headlines to pump and dump it this week. AAPL trying to get some AI on their phones with partnerships from Google and chinese companies. AAPL getting sued by Biden admin cuz Trump says he likes to suck off Tim Cook on his CNBC interview. Do these headlines truly affect price though? I doubt it. If there was such concern, their market makers wouldn't have taken the risk to stick AAPL to 172.5 (strike price) over the weekend.

If you follow AAPL closely, you'll notice these guys actually have so much control over their own stock price they regularly burn both sides on earnings. Opex almost always settles at max pain. Not only do they control their stock price, they control the Chinese and American governments. Their stock is a little bit down, but it hasn't diminished their power nor influence. They're still one of the biggest indirect employers in China via their supply lines. In the US they have mind control over about half the population of adult voters and are one of the largest sources of tax revenue.

SO WHY THE FUCK IS AAPL's STOCK DOWN RELATIVE TO THE MARKET!? It's simple. There needs to be an area of intense consolidation for investors to really dial into pushing price higher. Nobody wants to load AAPL at 200 to push for their next step at like 220-230. They want it at 170. That's a much better risk proposition.

NVDA is leading the way and will probably top out at like 5000 or something. Yup, a 13 trillion dollar valuation. The thing is the market just has no chill when it comes to understanding this next wave of economic gains is going to replace most of the workforce by 2030 and businesses won't have to deal with payroll anymore, just taxes. It's gonna be a world just like the Hunger Games, but with a twist of Terminator.  And you're gonna wanna stay long so you're part of the bourgeoisie and not the class of people waiting for bread crumbs wondering what the hell the point of their existence is (to get killed by robots and bio-engineered viruses).",wallstreetbets,https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1blqeqo/craapl_is_a_buy_the_ai_bull_market_is_only/,2024-03-23 07:53:47,0.06886200716845878,0.3095218401670014,0.088,0.06,0.0
Why SMTC is dropping after earnings,"Hello regards,

First I’d like to point out as of now I’m the only one who thinks SMTC is going to drop (check earnings discussion). 

I’ve been looking into previous earnings. July 2023 (Sept 13th) before earnings we were at the exact same price as we are now. That day saw an increase of around 8%. It’s very important to highlight that, for that Quarter EPS was beat by over 400% and accumulated a revenue of 236M dollars (still being net negative btw). 

This Quarter, SMTC is supposed to have 190M in revenue which is significantly worse, and is only 40M higher than Jan 2023 Quarter where we saw the stock plummet. IMO for the stock to rocket after earnings EPS has to be significantly beat even more than the 400% July was able to achieve. Even then, the stock only jumped 8% and with earnings being a projected 45M less I don’t see how this stock goes up.

This is not financial advice

Possibility of Upcoming Mergers: Targeted Alpha Therapy companies,"In the last few months, two targeted alpha therapy (TAT) companies have been snapped up in mergers.  Both paid out a ~100% premium over the share price. 

I can only find two other publicly-traded companies in that space: CATX and DRTS.

I'm not going to explain what TAT is unless you ask. I assume finely regarded people like yourselves are well-educated, curious, and capable.

Both RYZB and FUSN sold for ~$2 billion.  If either CATX or DRTS were purchased for a similar amount, the share prices would be ~$3 and $25, respectively.

So in the best case, CATX has 100% upside and DRTS is much higher.

I have no clue if either are any good.

Here are links for the two that merged already: [RYZB](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bristol-myers-squibb-completes-acquisition-133500439.html) and [FUSN.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fusion-fusn-99-2-4b-172100147.html)

MRNA: Remember That Falling Knife? I Think It's Hit Bottom (And a RARE Adam and Eve Pattern is Forming on the Weekly Chart),"Three months ago, I dared to tread where many portfolios went to bleed – calling a potential bottom on Moderna (MRNA)  [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/18llx12/buy\_the\_rumor\_on\_mrna/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/18llx12/buy_the_rumor_on_mrna/).

The ""Covid stock"" was a graveyard of failed bottom-fishing attempts... but I saw something different, just like I did with SQ (check out that successful call here) [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/17r7p3z/block\_inc\_sq\_high\_probability\_technical\_bullish/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/17r7p3z/block_inc_sq_high_probability_technical_bullish/).

**The Technicals Were Right (Again) – And This RARE Weekly Pattern is Emerging**

Those bullish signals I outlined back in November? They're evolving beautifully, and something even more compelling has emerged on the weekly chart: a classic Adam and Eve double bottom pattern. This isn't just any pattern – it's known for its power in signaling bullish reversals, and it's especially significant when it appears on a longer-term timeframe like a weekly chart.

* **Adam's Dive (Nov 2023):** That sharp drop formed the first bottom (Adam).
* **Eve's Softer Landing (Feb 2024):** A rounder, gradual bottom (Eve) suggests buyers are stepping back in.
* **The Rarity Factor:** Adam and Eve patterns don't show up every day, and their presence on a weekly chart makes this one even more significant.
* **Momentum Divergence & More:** The other signals (divergence, Heikin Ashi, money flow) are still backing this up.

**Crucial Breakout Needed:**  For true confirmation, we need a decisive close above the high of $115.97 (from Jan 8th, 2024).

**The News Backs It Up**

Remember that Merck/Moderna skin cancer vaccine update? The market does – and it seems to love the Adam and Eve setup forming alongside this news. And while those declining COVID booster numbers sting for some, Moderna's superior efficacy and revolutionary technology shines brighter than ever.  Moreover, notable investors like Cathie Wood have stepped up their position in MRNA noted in an an article ironically titled, ""Is Cathie Wood Buying the Rumor?"" (Welcome to the party Cathie).

Ralph Lauren ($RL) is a 10+ bagger,"Consumer Discretionary and Retail stocks have shit the bed on earnings calls these last few months. That is DESPITE the fact that almost all of them have beat earnings in Q4 2023.

The problem is guidance.

NKE went double down TWICE. First in December when they posted weak guidance. Then again just yesterday. They beat earnings estimates both times. They're down about 23% since their December earnings call. Again, despite beating earnings on both quarters.

FL fell off a cliff, down 30% since their earnings (also weak guidance, but they also fucked up earnings).

LULU RIP on weak guidance (down 16% since their call yesterday).

Consumer confidence was high at the holiday season, but it's come back down to reality. January consumer spending shocked to the downside. February consumer spending was lower than expectations.

January CPI print was higher than expected.

February CPI was higher than expected.

March CPI gonna be fucked. Look around, gas prices going up, war in the middle east, Red Sea shipping and insurance prices have gone up.

Consumer confidence is fucked. People are sobering up to the reality that inflation is here to stay, even if JPow does a wink-wink, 3 rate cuts this year. If March CPI is fucked, that goes out the window too.

\--

&#x200B;

Now, let's look at RL. Surely, it should be down given all of these macro concerns for consumer discretionary, the american consumer (as evidenced by LULU guidance with softening NA sales).

NOPE. about 2% off the all time high (192) sitting at $197.60 (and that's after a 1.5% down day).

This is the MF'ing chart. It's up 28.47% YTD. It's trading like a tech AI stock. But it ain't.

Notice that cliff at $170 to $140. If it falls, especially on bad earnings & guidance, it'll fall through that floor.

Earnings is anticipated some time between May 21st and May 24th. Unfortunately the options for this ticker are monthly and quarterly (not weekly), so the May monthly options will be just short of the earnings date. I've got puts for June at $150.

On the other hand, Lululemon slightly topped analysts' revenue and EPS expectations during the quarter. The company's growth was driven by a 12% increase in its same-store sales, with American stores growing 7% and international stores growing 44% on a constant currency basis. Overall, it was a weaker quarter for Lululemon.

Bitcoin price data around halvings (time from halving until bull run),"For the 2nd halving, which occurred on July 16th, 2016, it was approximately 284 days before BTC began its bull run. For the 3rd halving, which occurred on May 11th, 2020, it was approximately 161 days before BTC started its bull run (I keep saying ""approximately"" because it's subjective, I picked a date to mark the beginning of the bull run that looked right to *me*, others will have different opinions). This is a reduction in time between halvings and the beginning of a genuine bull run of 43.3%. If we were to see this occur again in 2024, that would mean that there will be 69.7 days between the halving and the beginning of a bull run, placing it around **June 29th, 2024** (presuming the halving occurs on the estimated date of April 20th). Make of this what you will.

Note: we didn't have ETFs, MSTR, and some of the other shit that we do now, when the previous halvings occurred. I don't know what that means, precisely. I would guess that it will reduce the space in between the halving and the next bull run even more, but I don't know that, obviously.

Lost $25K in a single day - 2021 meme stock roller-coaster revisited," Hey fellow degenerates,

Let me take you back to a simpler time, Dec 2020 - Jan 2021, when I, a bright-eyed and bushy-tailed newbie, decided to dive headfirst into the murky waters of options trading. Armed with nothing but the Robinhood app and dreams of Lambos, I embarked on what can only be described as a financial roller-coaster.

In the span of a little over a month, I managed to execute 36 trades. My instruments of choice? Calls on LUCID, ""stock-that-shall-not-be-named"", and PMC. Yes, I was riding the meme stock wave, hoping to surf my way to untold riches. Spoiler alert: it didn't go as planned.

Here's the breakdown:

* Total Gains: $30,000
* Total Losses: $50,000

As you can see below, I had a win rate of about 50%. Not too shabby for a rookie, right? Wrong. Because amidst these battles, there was one day, January 25th, that will forever be etched in my memory. 

**On that fateful day, I managed to lose $25,000 in a matter of minutes, as the short squeeze came to an abrupt end when Robinhood decided to halt options trading.** This was equivalent of my 6 months pay at that time. And poof, just like that, it was gone! 

**I literally had a GUH moment and I remember my hands trembling in disbelief that I was down $25,000 in less than 2 minutes . I don't play poker or gamble otherwise, so this shock was particularly severe and I did what any rational person would do - I deleted the Robinhood app** and tried to erase the entire episode from my mind!

For three long years, I avoided confronting the reality of what happened. But today, I mustered the courage to look back at my Robinhood history and reconcile with my past.

Why am I sharing this story on here, you ask? Because it's cathartic and today was the first day I'm seeing all these trades after 3 years of being away from robinhood. Now that I look back, I think had I not lost $25,000 on that day, I would have probably continued to make bigger and bigger bets until I finally lost it all. Typical gambler's fallacy. 

The $25K lesson I learned was trite but very humbling - NEVER play with more than what you can afford to lose! Which also means YOLOs are out of the question.

What the actual heck happened with LULU,"We are in a market where a company like LULU that increased profits 400% YoY dumps -20% because it didn't outperform its massive outperformance. We're pricing everything like its Nvidia, so when a company merely does great (comparatively) and isn't 3x'ing every quarter the speculation deflates so quickly ON POSITIVE EARNINGS. When we are at the point where stock prices reflect speculation on exponential future growth, any indication of slow down IN GROWTH collapses a stock, thats how you know we are in a bubble. With an astronomical P/E in the 60's before today, 16% Sales Growth YoY isn't enough in this market. I think LULU is just a demonstration of what could happen to many other tickers that are pricing in decades of double digits growth when a company magically can't maintain that rate of growth.

COIN: The next 50x play,"Alright boys. First, check out my username. I’ve been in crypto for a long time just to trade and have called every single BTC top. I’ve had puts on BTC since 73k (proof: https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/s/ryWIFUSMWV). Check the downvotes. But you know what, this play doesn’t even rely on BTC. Heck it could go to 100-150k for all I care (it won’t) but one thing is for sure: 

COIN is going down. Why? 

1. Their customer service is absolute crap. They only just started phone support after many years and none of them can even speak English 

2. **Every single** fast BTC move results in the exchange being shut down. This has been a problem on their exchange for many years with no fix in sight. **Not a single other major crypto exchange** (Binance/Bitmex/Deribit/etc) has this problem despite having **more** volume than Coinbase 

3. The IV isn’t atrocious like it is on MSTR yet and not many shorts on the stock hence no ensuing squeeze. Most of you regards can actually afford it   

4. Brian Armstrong’s wife has been cheating on him

5. I have puts

6. (And this is probably most important): ETF inflows are slowing down. These ETFs use coinbase for a lot of their higher volume buys. Less volume = less revenue for coinbase

The CATALYST IS NOT SOME OBSCURE SHAREHOLDER MEETING. Do you think Trumps 6 million Truth Social followers know that the meeting took place today?

**The catalyst is the ticker change to $DJT.** For the first time, the world's *best self-promoter* will have his own stock and an army of people to tweet to!!! Look at how this dude tweets and how people eat it up:

# Why would he have tweeted about it or pushed it until it becomes ""his stock""? It would have been stupid. Believe me, the average MAGA member is not thinking:

""Hmmm well the merger meeting of the SPAC $DWAC was today and I see that the lockup period is XYZ""

They *will be thinking come Monday:*

$SAVA short - Alzheimers drug maker forgets to follow the rules,"""Cassava Sciences, Inc., a clinical stage biotechnology company, develops drugs for neurodegenerative diseases. Its lead therapeutic product candidate is simufilam, a small molecule drug, which is completed Phase 2 clinical trial"".

They were mired with controversy when it was found that Wang, a co-developer of simufilam, had falsified data in early testing. [https://www.science.org/content/article/co-developer-cassava-s-potential-alzheimer-s-drug-cited-egregious-misconduct](https://www.science.org/content/article/co-developer-cassava-s-potential-alzheimer-s-drug-cited-egregious-misconduct)

That tanked the stock and we're at around 20 but I strongly believe there is much more room to fall. There's a pending lawsuit against the company from shareholders, and it's undergoing phase 3 which is likely to fail given the shoddiness of the science behind it. 

Here's their response 

[https://www.cassavasciences.com/news-releases/news-release-details/statement-cassava-sciences-regarding-internal-cuny-report-leaked#:\~:text=The%20short%2Dsellers%20alleged%20that,other%20forms%20of%20research%20misconduct](https://www.cassavasciences.com/news-releases/news-release-details/statement-cassava-sciences-regarding-internal-cuny-report-leaked#:~:text=The%20short%2Dsellers%20alleged%20that,other%20forms%20of%20research%20misconduct).

They have distanced themselves from Wang and claimed that their current research is independent from the findings of Wang, and that many of the issues have to do with ""improper record keeping""

My neuroscience PHD friend says this in response

""Wang's research is literally the entire basis of their stated MOA. I have never been more sure of the science, just when the market catches up is a guess.

Also look at their phase 2 biomarker study. They initially got their biomarkers tested by the leader in the field who found absolutely zero effect of the drug. Then a month later they said that analysis was wrong and an ""independent lab"" had retested and found literally every marker to have significantly dropped. That ""independent"" lab turned out to be Wang, who didn't even use correct procedures and most likely faked it all (the short group I'm in did an analysis showing that the results he got are a statistical impossibility). It's faked all the way through ""

This is a long play - this stock has a tendency to stick around way longer than it should. It also often has a few random pumps so today might not be the best day to enter. I suspect a decent amount of manipulation is happening since their market cap is less than a billion and volume is low. 

I have may and august dated puts at around 15 and 12.5 strike.

DD Bitcoin Double-Bottom Play,"DD of Bitcoin's latest saga, and what I think is a signal...

we find ourselves at a critical juncture. After reaching an ATH of \~$73.8K, Bitcoin experienced a sharp decline to $60,900, rallied to nearly $68K, and is now on a trajectory towards the $61-$62K range. This sequence is not random market behavior but appears to be sculpting a classic **double-bottom pattern**, signaling a potentially bullish turnaround. If this doesn't looks like a 'W' then I don't know what does...

&#x200B;

[damn girl, you got some nice curves](https://preview.redd.it/nzmd6qhfowpc1.png?width=1766&format=png&auto=webp&s=bded943217c38221a71aef12601f270a1aca0b04)

**The significance of this pattern forming around the $61-$62K mark cannot be overstated.** It indicates a strong market consensus that Bitcoin, at this level, represents a substantial buying opportunity--a rare double bottom, aka 'W'. This moment could very well mark the shift in narrative, reinforcing the value Bitcoin holds in the eyes of investors ESPECIALLY with the halving just 28-29 days away.

Grayscale's decision to significantly reduce its Bitcoin holdings adds another layer of complexity. This move has prompted a flurry of activity, with some investors quick to sell off, possibly eyeing the allure of lower-fee ETFs. This shake-up serves as a litmus test, separating bishass 🧻🤲 spooked by short-term volatility from the steadfast believers in Bitcoin’s long-term promise.

**The rebound from the $61-$62K range will be pivotal.** A robust bounce back, particularly if supported by significant trading volume, would solidify the bullish implications of the double-bottom pattern.

The challenge now is to breach the resistance near $68K. Surpassing this level would not just signal recovery but could also mark the beginning of a new bullish phase for Bitcoin...

Based on the Fibonacci extension levels calculated from the most recent low of $16,246 and the previous cycle's high of $65,483 for Bitcoin, if the 'W' forms...the potential next All Time Highs (ATHs) could be around:

* **161.8% extension level:** Approximately $145,148
* **261.8% extension level:** Approximately $194,385
* **423.6% extension level:** Approximately $274,051

If you're a real nuggethead and want to double-down on a more leveraged play, this is where **MSTR** Calls would be a ballsy move right now.

Grayscale's strategic divestment and the market's response underscore the volatile, yet resilient nature of Bitcoin. This episode is a clear test of investor cajones, distinguishing 🧻🤲 vs. 💎🤲.

**Your move.**

I've seen some terrible SPAC deals in the past 3 years but DWAC is another level of hell,"I've followed the SPAC market in the last 3 years and almost been involved in a de-SPAC myself before raising $175m in a private round.

Often the de-SPAC merger slide decks are full of caveats to get the bankers off the hook, with tiny footnotes that absolve the intermediaries of any blame. 

But the DWAC deck is off the charts. The estimates of TMTG revenues and users are literally question marks, like literally the symbol ""?"". Seriously, see page 10:-

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1849635/000119312521348593/d242442dex992.htm

The revenue numbers are underpinned by silly assumptions on the last pair of slides and show literally $0 from subscriptions in the actuals for 2021. Literally zero. 

And yet there are statements like ""Could TMTG+ reach 10m subscribers and contribute to a highly valuable enterprise?"" (p.35). Well, could it, starting from zero? 

I've never seen anything more likely to lose investors all their money and hand a big stack of cash to the sponsors and possibly Trump if he can wangle himself out of the 6 month lock-up. If the SPAC doesn't see very high redemptions prior to trading it would be amazing.

Absolute long-dated put below the money today if you want to get rich. SPACs are mostly garbage, but this one is off the charts bad. Kerrisdale did a really good takedown a while back:

DWAC is dropping to $2.5 after the merger and here’s why (your calls are fucked),"dd pulled from chester-ming s comment

Positions:
700 2.5p April 19, 2024

After the merger this is going to shit the bed.
Trump is gonna dump some of his shares. ""But what about his lockup??"" you say. Allow me to explain, it's tin-foil hat time:

DWAC could waive his lockup at the last minute (they can do this, it's noted in SEC filings), and he'll dump shares on the open market for cash so he can pay for his legal woes. It's possible that he could have two days to sell shares before he even has to disclose his sells publicly. DWAC may be able to waive the lockup at the 11th hour before even notifying shareholders.
Remember that meeting earlier in the month with Elon and Trump shrouded in secrecy - everyone thought it was a meeting about Elon giving Trump money for his campaign? Wrong. I theorise that they were doing a mutually-beneficial deal:

Elon agrees to ensure Trump never gets banned from X under any circumastances, ensuring he always has a soapbox.

Trump agrees to return to X, giving Elon a huge bump in viewers, potentially saving X from ruin.
Trump dumps his shares, pays his legal bills, makes a shit ton of money, gets a much bigger audience on X compared to Truth Social. It's a win win for both of them.

Trump doesn't like tricky businesses that are difficult to run and make money from, he likes simple grifts. Social media takes a lot of time, effort and money to make a profit from, especially these days (see Reddit not making profit ever, or Twitter burning through cash for years). He didn't really set up TS as a proper business, he just wanted to create something so people could hear what he says since he was banned from Twitter at the time. He's been unbanned now tho, and Elon runs it, and that's where the audience will be for him in the run up to the election.

Trump will want a quick exit and the merger is a perfect opportunity for him to do so. He's also desperate now since NY is about to start sizeing his assets - Trump Tower or Truth Social? Not gonna be a difficult decision for him.

After this the share price will absolutely tank and the company will collapse into bankrupcy.
Oh and IV on options is going to shit the bed on Friday. Also DWAC could very possibly not get enough votes and adjourn the meeting, it's happened many times before. Again call options will get destroyed if this happens.

Don't trade on the info in this comment i'm probably wrong, and i'm usually wrong. But maybe i'm right this time...who knows.

TLDR:
Trump need money. Trump have legal loophole. Trump sell shares. Good time to buy far otm puts before Monday. DWAC fucked.

$DWAC rug pool,"By now most of you have heard of $DWAC and know today's news about the merger vote, most of you also know the Daddy Trump has a small fine due on Monday.

For those less informed, let's break it down:

$DWAC is a SPAC (special purpose acquisition company) that is set to have a meeting today to merge with Truth Social (Trumps social media site) to effectively list Truth Social on the NYSE.

If this vote goes through Trump will be the owner of 58% of Truth Social. Also if the Merger goes through the combined value of DWAC and Truth Social will be around $5b in market cap, effectively giving Trump around a $3b asset.

Let's take a look at that $5b valuation, Truth Social had a revenue stream of $3.38m for the first 9 months of 2023 and a net operating loss of $49m over the same time period. Furthermore, the revenue decreased as the months went by as the operating loss increased as the months went by. According to their regulatory filing they ""expect to incur significant losses into the foreseeable future"".

From an economic standpoint from experts ""Given their sales...It's hard to believe that the long-term economic value of this company could be as high as $100m...so talking about billions is absolutely ridiculous.""

Let's dive deeper and look at their user base. Truth Social has around 5 million active users as of Feb 2024, this is compared to over 2 billion users on TikTok and 3 billion users on Facebook. Furthermore app download numbers show that a majority of the user accounts have been around for years, with monthly user growth less than 10% of what it was in 2022.

Okay, so the company is looking over-valued and doesn't show signs of great growth, what does the settlement have to do with it?

Back in February Trump was ruled against in a civil fraud case and ordered to pay $355m + interest. That bill has now increased to $465m and is due on Monday 3/25.

On top of this Trump has been denied his stay from this payment in the now famous quote ""you have failed to explain, much less justify any basis for a stay."". So Trump has since done the reasonable thing and tried to secure a bond to cover the fine. This hasn't gone great as he was reportedly denied by over 30 banks for a bond to cover the settlement. This means a few things:

1. The banks that get special access to his assets to decide if they want to issue the bond, have determined the risk of him not paying the bond is not worth the collateral assets he offered.

2. The banks believe that there is little chance he will win an appeal of this settlement.

3. He's pissed off a lot of banks, probably because of the aforementioned fraud.

Ultimately this means that Trump will have no recourse but to pay the settlement on Monday or the asset-seizure process will begin.

So what are his options? Well he's got a $3b asset that is about to land in his lap, that is a pretty big option, however, there are hurdles.

First off, the merger has to get approved at today's meeting, that will officially list Truth Social on the NYSE. That's hurdle one.

The problem then becomes that Trump would have a 6 month holding period where he can't sell his stock. That is, unless by another vote they offer an exemption to this rule. If the exemption is issued, Trump will have the right to sell his holdings at the bell on Monday, the same Monday he has a $465m fine due and has shown he doesn't have the liquid assets to cover. That's hurdle two.

If this happens, he could sell near 30% of his holdings, which would equate to about 19% of the total Truth Social market cap or around $1b to cover his settlement. This will send the stock into absolute free fall come Monday.

If this process were to play out this way, it would be the all to common reverse-robinhood. Taking money from the poor, to fund the riches settlements for having shady business practices.

Is this a fact in stone? No, there are hurdles of course. However, given the ridiculous over-valuation of this company, the lack of growth and user base and the potential for a whale dump, all I'm saying is tread lightly my friends.",wallstreetbets,https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bkzy79/dwac_rug_pool/,2024-03-22 10:01:00,0.08107539682539684,0.45093990929705213,0.059,0.125,0.9908

Marketwise (MKTW) are going to massively beat their Q1 earnings,"So most of you are probably never gonna have heard about this company and those that have probably think it's dogshit. Marketwise is a company that sells stock newsletters. Yeah, I know. It's one of those companies that makes fake news articles about the stock market written by a AI or some Indian guy on Fiver. They then try to funnel these clicks into their paid newsletters. If you ever have gotten a bunch of spam emails for ""top 5 hidden AI gems that will 20x your portfolio"" then you probably are on Marketwise email list.

Now Marketwise products sucks. There is no denying that. That could also be a opportunity though. I think we all can agree that the market is extremely hot right now. There are lots of new investors that just wanna get into the market and have no clue about anything. This is gonna be the first quarter where the market is back into mania mode since 2021. This benefits Marketwise immensely. People want to get rich and they want to get rich quickly. In 2021 Marketwise revenue hit an all time high. In part that was because they massively increased advertising but it was also due to a lot of just general market mania. Everything was hitting all time highs and everyone wanted to find the next memestock Now I see a lot of parallels to now. Nvidia is flying to insane valuations and bringing loads of bad stocks (any soundhound baggies here lul) with it just through pure market euphoria. 

Marketwise as a company has performed terribly basically forever. They went public via a spac in 2021 and have basically went straight down with some bumps here and there since. This is despite the fact that their business plan should be really profitable. I mean they are basically selling random stocks that are trending for thousands of dollars to people who don't know better. I mean they have billings for 650k per employee. That's as high as some tech stocks. The CEO also revealed they will not make the same mistakes as in previous years where they increased the spending instead of focusing on their margins. They are already cutting personnel and focusing on efficiency in their marketing.

They also have a 120 millions dollars in float apparently. What's float you ask? Well it just so happens to be Warren Buffets favorite thing. It's money that they can't report as earnings yet but still get to hold on hand. And while they have that money they can earn interest on it. Now with interest rates being high earning a cool 3-4% should be really easy for them meaning that not only do they have a strong reason to have great increases in sales. They might also report a good chunk of change from interest on their float.

Marketwise is being valued as being dead in the water. Extremely few people know about this company and even those that do have all but dismissed it as a scam heading for bankruptcy. I disagree and so does an insider executive too apparently since he bought 25k worth of Marketwise stock 2 days ago.

Another insider that recently bought was the CFO. That's the Chief financial officer for you less smart people. Now I shouldn't have to explain why the money guy buying stocks is bullish.

When they release their Q1 earnings which I think will be really good I suspect this stock could go up as much as 50%. They haven't announced when they will report their Q1 earnings but based on previous years they usually do around the second week of May. Until then I will be buying as much of their cheap stock as I can.

The insane $TSLA bull case no analyst sees coming yet,"BUCKLE UP MFKERS, I GOT THE SCOOP FOR THE NEXT MOONING (AS BIG AS AI WAS)

**TLDR (cuz who here can actually read):** Idgaf about TSLA as a car company, soon noone else will too. Due to China and nerds making insane tech, humanoid robotics will be HUGE by late 2024. TSLA the company that will win this race. Market will realize in a cuppa months. Market for this is 20-100T USD with infinite growth potential. TSLA is quietly becoming the NVIDIA of humanoid robotics.

AI hype has hit the street, you know what that calls for: it's time to pivot to what the old f\*cks on the street is blind to (cuz they're so old).

Humanoid robotics. Any hedge fund manager would laugh, that's why it's genius.

1. Robotics has been around for a long time, but try programming a robot the same way you program a computer and ofc it will fail. It can't reason the way we reason. Since AI popped off, robotics has been reaping the rewards. While yall sleeping, terminator is being built. Check rate of progress from 2022 -> 2024, it's insane and show no signs of slowing.
   1. This is not the boring toyota drunk robots that can't do sh\*t. This is solid progress made at supersonic speeds on making robot workers for real. There is no limits to this actually working, it's an engineering problem at this point and a matter of time.
2. Ofc Xi Jing Ping is sharper than any of the dementia patients sitting in congress. China makes savvy decisions and guess what their plan is: **500 humanoid robot workers / 10 000 ppl by 2025. That is** **3.8 million humanoid robots.** They have put their money where their mouth is and gone b a l l s deep on investment into this. They are showing good results and making insane progress quickly.
   1. The implications here alone are huge: China US rivalry won't die anytime soon. This will force the hand of the US. A trump win would be huge as he can see stuff like this coming. He just needs to talk about it to legitimize the industry, and he surely will.
3. The market for humanoid robots is as big as the market for manual labour as long as the bots can perform the tasks efficiently. Analysts forecasts don't count towards the trajectory we are on. IE THE MARKET IS CURRENTLY 30% OF WORLD GDP WITH NEAR INFINITE GROWTH POTENTIAL.

Here is why TSLA will be a huge winner in this.

* Name of the game in AI is training data, talent and compute. Tesla has huge training data advantage as their vision models already are extremely good.
   * They have already chugged away at this problem for years and years as the chip needs to be inside the robot, and not in some huge gpu datacenter. Guess what they have in their cars: A lightweight, energy efficient chip for exactly this type of processing.
   * They have the human talent and is well regarded in the AI industry. Altough Grok so far has sucked, Elon realizes that it's immensily important to get this model smarter and is putting heavy focus on that. This is directly to augment their tesla bots with reasoning capabilities. Grok is specifically designed to solve reasoning unlike other AI models where the focus is more towards workplace efficiency.
   * They already have a multimodal model with language understanding inside their bots.
   * We should see actually useful humanoid bots working in their factory this year. They will 100% use them internally a lot before selling anything. After proper field tests and refinement the market will be GASPING for these bots. They don't even need to be anywhere as close to good as perfect, they just need to be as good as 70iq darren in minnesota doing the same repetitive task over and over again. We already have that intelligence in language models today.
* Lack of AI day: To quote deranged Elon: *"" Some of our competitors look at what we do on a frame by frame basis. The same happened with Battery Day. So we have to be a little cautious, but some kind of update would be good to do. Will discuss with the team, maybe something later this year. Our main goal with these AI Day things is recruiting and to change the perception of Tesla as a car company.""*
   * Essentially, AI day has not happened bcause they don't want to give up their competitive edge, not because of lack of progress. Once Investors realize TSLA are capable as an AI company, market will reflect that.
* Manufacturing. Idc if figure01 from figureAI is good as balls, they have ZERO experience in manufacturing. Manufacturing these bots will be the hard problem to solve. There is no better company set up for this than TSLA. (MSFT is bull case long term too btw)
   * TSLA CAN TEST THESE BOTS LIVE IN THEIR OWN FACTORIES WHILE DEVELOPING, THE ADVANTAGE IS ENOURMOUS. Having integrated development for exactly the type of customers they would sell to once it's mature.
   * TSLA has walked the road of going from startup to one of the leading EV manufacturers. They continually develop their manufacturing processes, taking insane risks to make it more efficient. THERE IS NO OTHER COMPANY BETTER SET UP TO GET MASS PRODUCTION OF THESE BOTS GOING ONCE THEY'VE REACHED A VIABLE PRODUCT
* Chinese competition: China might very well beat tsla to the punch in this, this is good. Why? Because US would NEVER rely on china to make them their robots. They will turn this into a case of national security faster than i can inseminate my 5'2 mewtoo build gf.

And I haven't even gotten to the best part yet: it doesn't matter if these robots can take over the world or not, ALL THAT MATTERS IS THAT INVESTORS AT SOME POINT THINK THEY CAN. Riding the hype 'bubble' is irrelevant, only thing that matters is being ahead of the bubble.

As engineer, I see no reason that this will be a bubble, just a matter of time. What will be tricky is getting manufacturing up to scale, but from a moon case scenario - that doesn't fkn matter. All that matters is a belief that it will happen and tsla stock price will reflect it. There is NO DOUBT that they are the US company best set up to do this.

**MY POSITION:** Call options for TSLA 350 by dec 2025. (retrad bookie won't let me go higher)

**MY PREDICTION:** TSLA anywhere from 400 - Nvidia levels of valuation (750+) by late 2025. Short term we prolly won't see any gains on tsla due to this development hasn't gotten any hype yet but sometime this late summer / fall (Elon time accounted) we should see the hype about this getting started for real.

For earnings this week there really isn’t much going on except the one stock most people on here joined because of. And there are some other decent plays like Cintas (CTAS) which is a great company that I’m bullish on but options are very expensive.

So this is my prediction. McCormick and Company (MKC) will go up for two reason only. We passed the holidays where people made turkeys and to make a good turkey you need seasoning and who makes seasoning. MKC. That means it has to go up. Secondly MKC own Franks Red Hot and I really love franks red hot so it will go up.

"Weed, and why it's time. ","So. Let's get the green elephant out of the room. Weed will become readily available for sale to the general public estimated September 2024.

Marijuana has, and had been increasing in recreational use expentially over the last decade. The FDA has recently just called to drop marijuana from a Schedule 1, to Schedule 3 drug as restrictions on the funny tomato plant begin to drop.

This has opened up and exponential growth in sales quarter after quarter, with no signs of stopping. 

Market saturation? You wish. Bad product gets sold at a discount while high quality cannabis is still flying off shelves. 

Candles. A buncha green. Like weed. Coincidence? I think not.

Intel can't even hold 1% for the day.,"
Intel is recieving over $8b in grant money and plans to spend more than $100b over the next 5 years to expand its factories.

Would it be wise to sell now and buy it back when it falls another 50%? I don't see their revenue making up for all this spending. They are faced with heavy competition in the semiconductor industry and have made little progress while giving away billions in bonuses and stock awards.

Took a $35k loss and couldn't be happier,"First off, I was up $38,000 between mid February and 3/8.

My nightmare started on 3/8 at  beginning of market. I opened the following positions:

4/19 NVDA $1100c x3

4/19 NVDA $1200c x20

4/19 SPY $525c x20

Everything started great, was up $25k at 520am local time. Went for a morning run at 530am. Came home an hour later and looked at my portfolio to see the massive decline NVDA took from the $974 ATH moments before my run to an hour later. In a panic, I opened more positions:

3/15 NVDA $920c x5

3/15 SPY $515 X20

My cost basis was now around $75k. Completely over leveraged and overwhelmed. There was one day, Tuesday 3/12, where I could have closed my 3/15 NVDA calls after JPOW gave CPI report and everything bounced, but I missed it due to a work meeting. NVDA was up $30 overnight, but fell hard before market open.

At one point, I was $50k down and internally freaking the fuck out. I never meant to be so far leveraged, losing my entire 38k gain, and losing another 12k-15k. I fucked up, bad.

Long story short, I was able to close all my SPY positions for a small gain. But, my NVDA options were so far OTM, and I bought when NVDA was around $960, that theta and IV just crushed them.

All positions are finally closed, and I lost 35k. Somehow, I am still up about $2700 for the year, and I'll fucking take it. I lost the gains that I won by being greedy, getting lucky, and putting my family's hard earned fucking money on the line.

I experienced - first fucking hand - exactly what happens when you're over leveraged and a trade turns against you. I should have taken that God damn 25k gain on the morning of 3/8.

I have learned so, so much from digging deep within myself the past couple weeks and suffering internal shame, guilt, stress, frustration, etc., but also being serious about what I did wrong, and how to avoid such disaster. 

Do not get greedy. Take the fucking profit. You can always reenter.

Set a fucking stop loss.

Do not purchase 75k worth of options if you do not want to lose 75k,  because you absolutely can lose the whole God damn thing.

Take a fucking loss and close a losing position. Do not continue to ""hope"" things will turn around. A losing position is a loser. Deal with it.

Do not listen to the fucking idiots on Reddit with their bullshit posts saying ""NVDA part deux electric bugaloo to the fucking moon by Friday"". People don't know fuck all about fuck all. 

There it is. What a fucking shit show. Time to slow down, relax, and try again.

Clearing up DWAC misinformation,"So I've seen a few claims that are just baseless with all the DWAC hype so this post is just clearing up some of the popular ones with sources.

1. ""Trump will onload shares as soon as the merger happens""...  Business insider and gaurdian claim any larger shareholder of this company will not be allowed to sell until 6 months after merge (including trump)
2. ""The stock wont change ticker name to DJT""... According to Businessinsider linked below the company will receive an updated Symbol DJT for trading if the deal is approved.
3. ""merger wont go thru""... Trump is literally already suing those shareholders unwilling to cooperate in this vote and with this final meeting coming up tomorrow there is a chance it wont happen but with all the potential money to lose it'd be a disadvantage to vote against this merger now for any shareholder.

Hello it's reek again.  And disclaimer my handle is literally reek. It's not a sexy name, it's not a name that speaks to power, it doesn't even sound good when you say it.... it's reek. If it had a smell it would smell like butt cheese... you know that glue between your ass during a hot summer day when you forgot to use a dudewipe. Anyone who wipes their ass with just toilet paper.... I'm looking at you... disgusting. And stop wearing socks all the time it's weird we all know you have foot fungus it's a dead give away. Fix your damn feet!!!! Where was I.... oh yah.. so if you listen to me you deserve to lose money.

I said I would post a update  if people actually read  the post, and you bastards actually did! Surprising, and congrats you lost some IQ points.  Anyway, was having trouble coming up w/ a update because the original post was a such a concise fundamental breakdown of the bull case for $HIMS. However, that changed the other night ...So I popped a hims dick mint before mounted this chick. I lasted  5min b4 nutting not bad but a a new record me (4min longer than usual),  so I was feeling  great!! then the post nut clarity hit and things stopped being linear and I saw connections everywhere pure enlightenment and in that moment I realized the magnitude of the opportunitny (*btw post nut clarity is a real thing sex energy is the  energy of creation so if you bust that nut strong enough you see god - ""Think and Grow Rich"" by Napolean Hill*). Two thoughts came into my mind: 

1.  the only  occupation a person keeps when they win the lottery ... crack hoe 
2.  if u think hard enough a dick pill can fix anything.

Ive gone down the rabithole and have verified (w/ 100% cold hard facts) that dick pills can in fact fix anything. The war, the election Mango vs the geriatric, ice spice (so so sexy).... everything pales in comparison to what I'm about to reveal..... clench your buttholes I'm abouut to take you on a journey....

Pop a boner mint and finally feel something for once. Instead of fucking go to a park with your swinging dick and meditate on a flower. Ignore the boner and see the beauty of the flower & its oneness with the universe. 

.......

This is why $HIMS will dominate they recognize a truth about life. A core truth . Hard cock = happy life. Even if your 22 and ur dick works fine, pop that boner mint no harm. And these vigilantes  are spreading the word of GOD, just like Buddha, Jesus, John Smtih (the Mormon). Once your  on the pill you realize it fixes EVERYTHING IN YOUR LIFE. Think of the ramifications. 

Also from personal experience subscriptions to the pills are surprisingly hard to cancel. Your like yup I'll take these pills every month and only use half of them... they beat you into submission. Great business model.

Theres another post that talks about the weird options [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bij68z/go\_long\_boners\_hims\_dealing\_pills\_filling\_bags\_dd/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bij68z/go_long_boners_hims_dealing_pills_filling_bags_dd/) I'm too lazy to paraphrase but yah the options seem mispriced.

"Jimmy March 26th, market close Q4 earnings","Aside from Black Friday/Christmas, video game sales will be very strong due to the fall releases of new games dominating charts for the year. I’ve cherry picked the titles relating to large sales volume in Q4. This data is for physical copies, it doesn’t include copies downloaded.

Source: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-01-19/four-big-takeaways-from-the-bestselling-video-games-of-2023

20 bestselling games of 2023 — ranked by dollar sales:

1. Hogwarts Legacy
-Release date February 2023
-Release date for Switch, November 14, 2023

Sales surpassed 15 million copies prior to Switch release. Hogwarts sales ended the year with 22 million sold to take the #1 spot. It took the #3 spot for Switch in only 6 weeks.

2. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III (2023)
-Release date November 10, 2023

Mw3 took the #2 spot for only 7 weeks of availability. I can’t find the sales numbers for that period but Zelda took the #5 spot with 19.5 million. This puts it in the 20-22 million range.

3. Madden NFL 24 [EA Sports]
-Release date August 18th 2023

Madden came out in Q3 but still took the #4 best selling game in November. Sales were more spread out during the year than a huge burst on release.

4. Marvel’s Spider-Man 2
-Release date October 20th 2023

Spider-Man sold 2.5 million copies on release and over 10 million by year end.

7. Mortal Kombat 1
-Release date September 19 2023

Q3 release with strong Q4 sales.

11. Super Mario Bros. Wonder
-Release date October 20th 2023

12 million units sold in 2023. Wonder makes #11 on this list because this figure includes downloaded sales. Nintendo stated it’s the fastest selling Mario game ever. Physical sales will be very high.

Best Buy has already released Q4 earnings. It’s video game sales are included within its entertainment category. Sales for the category increased 8.4%, however this also includes dvd, blu-ray and other items that have been falling out of favour. If they reported just gaming it would be much higher. https://www.mediaplaynews.com/best-buy-q4-entertainment-revenue-increased-driven-by-video-games/

I’m betting it will be much higher, but if we apply the 8.4% growth to previous years Q4 $670 million software sales that’s a growth of $56 million.

RC business plan has been to close under performing stores and lower Selling, General and Administration expenses as much as possible. So far in 2023 the previous quarters SGA was reduced $107 million in Q1, $65 million in Q2 and $91 million in Q3. If we apply this years average reduction of $87 million to Q4, as well as the 8.4% gaming increase it points to a quarterly profit of over $180 million ($0.60 eps), I think it will be even higher. Analysts are saying $0.29 eps.

Last quarter with a small profit the stock ran to $19, last year with a $48 million Q4 profit it ran to $25. At $13.xx it makes a great trading opportunity. 

My trading position consists of 50 ITM, 20 OTM calls, 1800 shares, 37 bull spreads and selling of 5 cash secured puts. Long 1000 shares in another account 🟣

M&T Bank 40% of the C&I and CRE Portfolio Has not Been Examined,"[The Criticized C&I and CRE (dogshit) Loans slide here](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/36270/000095017024005179/mtb-ex99_1.htm) shows that only about 60% of criticized loans have been reviewed, leaving a notable 40% unexamined.

While this data point alone doesn't necessarily indicate impending bank failure, it does introduce some uncertainty about the true credit quality of M&T's loan portfolio. Without a comprehensive assessment of that remaining 40%, it's difficult to rule out the possibility that some of those loans may be at higher risk of default than currently recognized.

Thorough and timely loan reviews are an important risk management practice. If a meaningful portion of the portfolio is overdue for reevaluation, especially in economically sensitive sectors like CRE, it could suggest some weakness in credit risk oversight. It could also suggest that they are trying to obscure even more weaknesses in their portfolio than their underwater HTM treasuries.

I'm not smart, but I am pretty sure a collapse and then a bank run is coming to M&T Bank. I am curious to learn from others who actually know what all this stuff means. Please help me b/c I'm going short.

Time to make it SNOW some easy gains,"SNOW is a stock that killed earnings and smashed revenue at +99.56% and +31.53% respectively. Price pre earnings was 230 but right now it’s sitting at 165 with an average target price for the stock is 217.

www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/snow/analystestimates

Why is this? Because their old CEO retired so they revised guidance to a super conservative position, a “welcome gift” if you will. Super conservative being a 22% increase in revenue instead of a 38% increase.

https://s26.q4cdn.com/463892824/files/doc_financials/2024/q4/Q4-FY24-Earnings-Call-Transcript.pdf?utm_cta=ty-data-trends-2023-data-ai

This company is growing and scaling up, making their money by selling scalable data storage and collaboration tools within organizations. This means the more customers they acquire, the better deals they can negotiate with vendors to boost their profit margins.

www.investors.com/news/technology/snowflake-snow-stock-buy-now/

Based on the last year alone gross profit margin was up 78% due to their accelerated growth, but even at their conservative growth rate of 22% they are poised to be pulling in 76%, which they will most likely smash given their revision is simply based on a new CEO.

Hitting a bottom at 150 and rebounding upwards gives the stock a lot of room to grow before their next earnings which they will annihilate resulting in a mega boost in price.

It’s about to hit the 200MA at 175 with healthy skew growing above 167.5 and 170 so traders are bullish on this.

Why Viking Therapeutics (VKTX) is your ticket to raiding Wall Street (Analysis from a Regar.D),"Hello fellow regards, it’s time to load up on VKTX calls!!! When I visited their HQ last week, I was surprised to see that instead of some nerds developing drugs, everyone was actually a viking. Initially, I was frightened, seeing these behemoths with their war paint, epic beards, and hulking axes. What were they doing here? However, after speaking to their CEO (Ragnar Lothbrook) he told me that they stole a time travel machine when they raided Rome and used it to come here to set their sights on their next target: Wall Street. 

Okay it hurts my head to type like this so now I’ll actually tell you why you should buy VKTX. VKTX is currently developing a GLP-1 agonist (same class of drug as Ozempic, Mounjaro, and Zepbound) AKA the big chungus people drug. As many of you know from NVO and LLY’s recent moves, GLP-1 agonists are basically the AI of biopharma with some of the highest demands of any drug out there. Now here is why I’m buying VKTX instead of these power houses:

1) VKTX oral data: Here’s why I’m loading up on short term calls; the readout for the Phase 1 Oral trial for VK2735 is due before the end of March. Initially, this stock sold off from $95 due to NVO’s positive oral weight loss drug’s results. However, these results were fraudulent asf; sure the efficacy results were on the higher end, but over 50% of patients dropped out, and the sample size was composed exclusively of Japanese people. Ragnar’s oral data projections are 1-2%, however he’s lowballed before with their injectable weight loss drug (this hard out-performed expectations and caused the stock to rocket to $95). 

2) VKTX injectable: I’m too lazy to type out the reasons but basically they have the best GLP-1 agonist currently in development. They have almost a 100% chance of being bought out by some big name, I just have no idea when. Load up on leaps, the further out the better. Eli Lilly already offered a buyout at $50/share before they blew up and it’s rumored another big company offered a buyout at $85/share which they also refused. 

3) Not just a one trick pony: Ragnar isn’t putting all his eggs in one basket he’s also developing VK2809 and VK0214, for NASH and X-ALD respectively. Expect amazing data (Regar.D analysis right here) when the trial results are updated in April for VK2809. 

4) Earnings April 24th: Ignore this cause earnings are practically useless, but you should see a nice volatility spike here to sell into before earnings. 

Positions: 3/28 calls @ $85/90 (playing the oral readout data here), 4/26 calls @ $100 (playing the NASH data and if it’s not out will sell the day before earnings), 1/17/25 calls @ 135 (just playing the buyout possibility here, if you have more money try playing the 2026 calls)

TL;DR: Viking Therapeutics is being run by Ragnar and his fellow vikings who stole a time travel machine!!! Oral data is due before the end of march, NASH data and earnings in April, and a buyout on the horizon.

Regarding Reddit IPO to other social media,"I have a dumb question

Reddit going public shows us info about the company's financials. Interesting points from the S1 filing include: 

* $804mil rev in 2023 (20% higher than 2022)
* Net loss of $90 mil in 2023
* Net loss of $158 mil in 2022
* Negative free cash flows $85 mil 2023
* Negative free cash flows $100 mil 2022
* price to sales multiple of nearly 8x
* Almost all revenue comes from advertisements
* Reddit warns in its S1 filing that ""if redditors do not continue to contribute content, or if the content isn't valuable to other redditors, we may experience a decline in number of redditors accessing our products and services which could result in loss of advertisers  and may harm our reputation, business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects,"" 

&#x200B;

My question is, isn't this exactly how facebook works? Requires content from users to maintain a user-base, as well as revenue from advertisers? Facebook earned $134 bil in revenue in 2023. Meta posted a net profit of $39 bil in 2023.

&#x200B;

Wells Fargo And Their $1B Scandal Saga,"As WFC is up 15% this year, they keep their good dynamic (CNBC) since their loudest fake accounts scandal. And analytics say that they would go even higher this year (but I doubt it tho). 

So, I guess many of you heard about one of the biggest payment in history and also one of the loudest cases. So, the story started many years ago, in 2016, when Wells Fargo created millions of unauthorized customer accounts and imposed auto insurance on hundreds of thousands of clients.

Following that, in 2018, Federal Reserve issued several orders. For years WFC's been working under consent order, meanwhile reporting to investors significant improvements and not mentioning any compliance issues.

They were able to hide it until March 20th, and it only became known when the government disclosed this situation and the order issues. And right after the reports were published their stock obviously dropped.

Several months ago, Wells Fargo decided to pay damaged shareholders $1B while denying all the ""wrongdoings"". And they say that investors who traded WFC still can try to apply for the payment, so you [can check it](https://11thestate.com/cases/wells-fargo-settlement).

Anyway, even with the latest WFC situation, I am not sure they can beat their all time high in the future.

PLNT - Planet Fitness. Fast turn around opportunity?,"Planet Fitness is a gym chain known for its affordable memberships and its focus on creating a non-intimidating atmosphere for gym-goers. Here's a breakdown of some key points:

**Membership:**

* They offer two tiers of memberships: Classic and PF Black Card®.
* Classic memberships start around $10 a month and grant access to your home club. (This is the biggest draw, affordability)
* PF Black Card® memberships typically cost around $24.99 a month and come with additional perks like access to any Planet Fitness location, the ability to bring a guest, and access to premium digital workouts.

**Focus:**

* Planet Fitness promotes a budget-conscious product. It is super important in this economy where the costs of everything have gone up.
* They offer cardio and strength training equipment but tend to have less heavy machinery compared to some other gyms.
* Some locations include tanning beds and massage chairs with memberships.

**Other considerations:**

* Planet Fitness has been in the news recently due to a controversy regarding locker room access for transgender individuals \[Daily Mail\]. This may be a factor to consider depending on your values. (The dip in the stock price was similar to Budweiser, but I don't see this being a major contributing factor to people canceling an already dirt-cheap membership.)
* **Institutional Ownership : 112.17%**
* **Short Interest: 5.34%\*** (This seems out of date given that so many more shares are owned\*)

Here are some resources to learn more about Planet Fitness:

* Planet Fitness website: [https://www.planetfitness.com/](https://www.planetfitness.com/)
* Planet Fitness app: [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/planet-fitness-workouts/id399857015](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/planet-fitness-workouts/id399857015)

**My Thesis:**

The recent dip was a one-off fear-driven event, and I don't expect any Twitter barrage to have any lasting impact on the brand. This is not Budweiser where you have to go to the store spend money on them and walk out with the box. This is a gym that has historically sticky memberships. Especially when they only cost $10. That expense is an after-thought. 

**Position:** $60 calls for May

The next Semi-conductor / Data center play: Vertiv (VRT),"This stock has already been ripping for a while, and, like SMCI, I think it's gonna keep going parabolic. Why, you may ask? Well, let me tell you. If you watched the NVIDIA Keynote, there's something you probably missed due to your extra chromosome: If you want the most powerful Blackwell configuration, you're going to need a liquid cooling setup in your data center.

Guess what - most data centers do not currently have liquid cooling infrastructure to just plug and play your fancy new Blackwell rack.

Guess who is one of the few companies who companies who make liquid cooling infrastructure for data centers? Vertiv.

NVIDIA basically just put all the data center companies on notice: Get your shit modernized with liquid cooling, or get left behind. Blackwell is a few quarters out, and data centers are going to have to start modernizing now if they want to capture this business. Not to mention that this is likely to become the industry standard going forward as chips become more powerful, power hungry, and create more heat that can no longer be managed with air cooling. Vertiv orders are going to go off the hook - their stock already jumped 10% immediately after the NVIDIA GTC Keynote because people with brains started buying.

Their earnings are going to be some time in late April. I expect that they will guide to the moon, and the stock will follow. Check out the earnings ramp from the last 4 quarters:

Apple sued by Biden administration and 16 state and district attorneys over alleged iPhone 'monopoly power',"Among the suit's allegations:

-Apple prevents the successful deployment of what the DOJ calls ""super apps"" that would make it easier for consumers to switch between smartphone platforms.

-Apple blocks the development of cloud-streaming apps that would allow for high-quality video-game play without having to pay for extra hardware.

-Apple inhibits the development of cross-platform messaging apps so that customers must keep buying iPhones.

In a statement, Apple denied the allegations and accused the government of overreach.

“At Apple, we innovate every day to make technology people love —designing products that work seamlessly together, protect people’s privacy and security, and create a magical experience for our users,"" it said. ""This lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets. If successful, it would hinder our ability to create the kind of technology people expect from Apple—where hardware, software, and services intersect. It would also set a dangerous precedent, empowering government to take a heavy hand in designing people’s technology. We believe this lawsuit is wrong on the facts and the law, and we will vigorously defend against it.”

$GCT—Potential big opportunity? Masked by uncertainty and battling narratives!,"GCT is a tech/fulfillment logistics company that is insanely cheap by traditional metrics. It's growing revenues at 40% YoY, and is trading at a low FCF multiple while in hypergrowth. *If legit*, it's numbers mean a fair valuation compared to, say, Amazon, would be 5x from here in terms of EV/OFCF.

So why is it not there? Well, it's been accused of being a scam:

1. [Culper Research short report](https://culperresearch.com/) (gone up 400% since this btw)
   1. The bulk of the thesis was they observed warehouses and did not see much activity, and there were doctored photos showing warehouses being full. Please read it in full.
2. Even on WSB there's lots of speculation about [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bjhunm/is_gigacloud_technology_nasdaq_gct_a_scam/)

And recently, it sold off 33% AFTER releasing insane earnings where it beat EPS .83c to mid 50c and grew revenue at nearly 100% YoY!

https://preview.redd.it/s9u7e1rk6ppc1.png?width=1162&format=png&auto=webp&s=db8e2f407e43eeee5993396d9bced8a41b9f6006

However, what you might not know is that a manager on Value Investors Club (stock writeup site where Michael Burry and others used to post) literally camped outside GCT warehouses to observe that there is business activity going on. They also inspected the warehouses, refuted many of the points in the report, etc. I can't share it but you can make a free account and check it out.

**Anyways, this is the important part. The 33% selloff has imo largely been due to a filing delay. Failing to file a Form 10-K on time appeared super sketchy to the market when a company is already regarded as suspicious. HOWEVER:**

[fine print!](https://preview.redd.it/myxmvo0g7ppc1.png?width=2084&format=png&auto=webp&s=878a78945f1f1d48fbfd4cb088aa7037cd9d1ca6)

*So if you actually read the reason why, you see it's that they want to become a domestic US filer rather than a foreign Chinese filer. This would INCREASE scrutiny and they would go from being audited by a foreign company to being audited by a US accounting firm! In my opinion, this would be an insane decision if the company was indeed a scam.*

**Tl;dr:**

1. You have a stock in hypergrowth trading at an insanely low valuation
2. The stock was the target of a short report, but another (likely) institutional investor refuted this report for their fund
3. Still, the rumors linger, so the 10-K delay tanked the price
4. The delay has an insanely reasonable explanation and in fact, imo, **makes it far less likely that the company is indeed a scam!**
5. This is a massive opportunity (in my opinion) because we already ""know"" the earnings which were prereleased and caused a 23% pop at the time:

https://preview.redd.it/avwzawy38ppc1.png?width=1334&format=png&auto=webp&s=168afb3945d9935ae22fffe960211d67b87df8d5

[Not half bad results, eh?](https://preview.redd.it/hlanqzkw8ppc1.png?width=826&format=png&auto=webp&s=e7bcec2bcaef8694b1c491846ddf2a83ffc4d740)

Now here's how I am playing. The updated 10-K should come out fairly soon, typically it takes several weeks. This should serve to ""derisk"" GCT in the eyes of the market, and I see no reason why it wouldn't trade back up to where it was, and even higher. Additionally, others may close shorts if the narrative changes. Therefore I am long May 17 40C in expectation of this catalyst:

Now here are the risks:

1. I have no idea how to really analyze a company. All I know is that you have two equally smart institutional investors battling it out. I personally found the bull more compelling, but many would not.
2. Insiders recently sold stock. I \*think\* but do not really know that this may be somewhat due to re-domiciling, but it may also be cashing out. However, the founder still owns a ton of shares. This is a guy whose stock went up 400% and he proposed to sell $5m. To me that is bullish.

https://preview.redd.it/504osoki9ppc1.png?width=2114&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c397f6e98e0d0da1b4773ac855caaa70ec538db

3. I am an absolute idiot and have no idea how to due accounting or valuation.

4. There is a lot of competition in the logistics industry and the short report in many ways did raise concerning points. You need to read it and do your own DD on both sides.

**Mega TL;DR**

1. **Stock goes up a ton.**
2. **What should be a non-event or a good-event (US domiciling) tanks it**
3. **After the air clears, stock goes back up a ton (?) and still would be undervalued**
4. **We can play this intelligently because there's a near term concrete catalyst**

$LULU Earnings Call Play,"Picked up a $LULU call expiring 3/28 ahead of their earnings call today post-market. 🚀

After seeing some WSB regards talking about the slew of weight loss drugs hitting the market last year, being approved by health insurance providers, more women are going to be interested in showing off their bodies. Because of this, and the usual Q4 holiday earnings, I am anticipating a positive earnings report. I'm banking on potential catalysts like revenue growth, margins, and guidance updates. A beat and raise scenario could send the stock up \~$50.

Market sentiment and macroeconomic factors could sway the outcome. It's a calculated gamble, but one with potential for handsome rewards.

So, I'm keeping a close eye on this play, looking for signs of bullish momentum and managing risk accordingly.

"Why you should buy MU, earnings highlights (spoiler: they smashed it)","# **Bookmark this, remind me 4months etc.**

As you *probably* know MU absolutely destroyed earnings and I think most of you should see these numbers and guidance - in my opinion, this is only going to keep rising into next earnings.

Up until now it has been 5 straight losses for the last 5 q’s, and the AI boom has really helped them flourish… to quote their CEO

>""Our preeminent product portfolio positions us well to deliver a strong fiscal second half of 2024. **We believe Micron is one of the biggest beneficiaries in the semiconductor industry of the multiyear opportunity enabled by AI**.""

**Revenue:** $5.82 billion vs analyst estimates of $5.35 billion (8.8% beat)

**EPS (non-GAAP):** $0.42 vs analyst estimates of -$0.24 ($0.66 beat)

**Revenue Guidance for Q2 CY2024** is $6.6 billion at the midpoint, above analyst estimates of $6.00 billion

**Gross Margin (GAAP):** 18.5%, up from -32.7% in the same quarter last year

**Inventory Days Outstanding:** 162, up from 158 in the previous quarter

Free Cash Flow was -$29 million compared to -$395 million in the previous quarter

**Market Capitalization:** $103.8 billion

They expect 75.9% yoy revenue growth for the next quarter

**Next quarter EPS guidance:** $0.38 - $0.52

**Next quarter revenue guidance:** $6.40 - $6.80 Bn

Compared to other semi stocks, MU is an absolute bargain at this price...

NKE puts for all you regards that lost money through TSM,"For all you regards who lost all your money this week, gather round cuz you can make it all back with puts on $NKE. 📉🔥

First off, these earnings coming up? They ain't lookin' pretty. Analysts getting cold feet and slashing those EPS and revenue estimates like there's no tomorrow. Revenue estimated to be down 1% YoY, operating income down 7%, EPS down 6%...I'm talking fiscal Q3 '24 lookin' like a dumpster fire. 🗑️🔥

China used to be Nike's golden goose but now it's turning into a lead balloon. Politics messin' with the brand and Winnie the Pooh ain't playin' nice no more. 🇨🇳💩 If China sneezes, Nike catches a cold.

Also, wanted to cop me some fresh Nikes from Footlocker the other day but they were out of my size. And those sales peeps couldn't care less about finding me an alternative. Nike losing mindshare on the sales floor, you heard it here first. 😤

Now I ain't no 🌈🐻 but facts are facts. EPS estimates down 11% in the last year, revenue estimates slashed by 5-9%. Free cash flow yield finally hitting 4% - first time since 2019! Too little too late if you ask me. 📉

Technical traders getting ready to short this to the earth's core if it breaks $82. Morningstar trying to prop it up with that cute lil $136 ""fair value"" but internal models ain't buying it, putting it between $85-100 tops. 📊

Nike might've bounced back from that ""brown shoe craze"" in the 90s but this feels different. Inventory to revenue ratios just getting back to normal after 3 brutal quarters...and who knows if this is the new normal. 📦📉

So unless JPow turns on the money printer again or Xi Jinping starts rocking Jordans, I'm staying the hell away from $NKE. Puts on deck, maybe nibble on some lottos if it craters post-earnings. 💸🎰

TL;DR - Nike r fuk, inversing Morningstar and buying puts on anything above $100. See you on the moon...or in the food stamps line. 🚀🍜

"RDDT's underpriced at 34 - when the bears focus on advertising and DAUs, they're fundamentally misunderstanding Reddit's new business model.","Listen, I get why people love shitting on Reddit's IPO on an emotional level. This site's power users love complaining about it, and that's fine, that's the nature of the internet. But never have I seen a group so devoted to leaving good money on the table as with the nerd rage over Reddit's IPO.

Yes, Reddit's future growth in advertising is dubious. Yes, I don't fully trust their DAU numbers, they have every incentive to cook those.

Neither are particularly important to Reddit's long-term profitability.

Licensing Reddit's data for AI training is the future of Reddit financially, and in this regard they're an apex predator. A few key points about LLMs, for the uninitiated:

-They need massive data sets of natural human language to train on

-That need is ongoing; each new generation of the most advanced LLMs requires ongoing updated data streams for a variety of reasons

-Many data sources that in the past would have been decent for LLM training have gotten worse over time, as algorithmically generated content displaces human content within the data set, and training an AI on AI-generated content produces shit results. Reddit's moderation is far from perfect but it's a much better guard against AI generated content than any of the other big socials have right now.

-the other big players in the ""sell our data for LLM training"" space, like the New York Times, offer a much narrower range of content than Reddit. The NYT struggling to get 10mil/year per company for access to their data (they're being offered 5mil and locking horns over it) versus Reddit getting 60mil/year per company out of the gate reflects this.

-no data set is perfect, but Reddit data comes ""pre-cleaned"" and ""pre-sorted"" to a much better extent than others, thanks to the subreddit, moderation, and upvote/downvote systems. Every conversation on Reddit fed into a LLM has already been rated and sorted by real humans via these systems.

-Reddit offers an incredible range of human conversation to train on. Short exchanges. Long exchanges. General human interest topics, and niche specialty/technical ones. Formal/highbrow writing and lowbrow meme humor. And for the most part, this training material is easily differentiatable and sortable thanks to the above systems.

-Reddit offers up-to-the-minute discussions of all of the above, which is huge for any LLM use that cares about integrating timely knowledge of current events into their offering.


In their prospectus, Reddit said they expected to make 200 million in AI training data sales over 3 years. We know already now that they were being too conservative; they've already signed a *single deal* with an AI company that's worth 60mil per year for the next 3 years, hitting that target on day one essentially. Another deal of the same magnitude -- and there's no exclusivity here, they can sell the same data to multiple firms -- and they'll have nearly doubled the target.

Reddit is sitting on a gold mine for the future; arguably the best continuously updated LLM training dataset in the world. I hope they grow advertising too,  but that's gravy on the potatoes, it's not the main course. If you think AI is going to underperform and underwhelm in the future, it would make sense to bet against Reddit, but otherwise I'm guessing all the folks on the IPO thread gleefully imagining Reddit going down to $2 are going to lose their shirt.",wallstreetbets,https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bjz244/rddts_underpriced_at_34_when_the_bears_focus_on/,2024-03-21 01:23:13,0.16689076916349643,0.3951714110805019,0.076,0.143,0.9932

After All That Shit Talk You Guys Are Posting Reddit Buys Like True Internet Nerds  ,"Of course everyone that said they were buying puts isn’t. You guys always do the inverse of what you say. 

I don’t know where the money came from to hit the top range because they were still sending those stock emails asking people to participate last night. 

I guess you guys pulled them through the finish line in typical WSB fashion.

Anyway. Good luck tomorrow. It’s gonna be a shit show here.

Also, I just left the Nvidia conference and what a disaster that was.

You don’t want to know where those $50k chips went after the Key note. People were still blowing micro processors out their nose at breakfast this morning.

It was clearly obvious this was the future. 

These guys couldn’t figure out how to properly build a better chip so they just glued two together and said they operate as one and that was true last night. 

It sounds like the developers cashed all their vested options and checked the fuck out completely.

They don’t have to fulfill all these promises and fantasy talks and actually deliver on the most ambitious plan ever constructed in the history of capitalism.

Not only that, they need every big tech company to join them at the hip forever while everyone else is concocting their own secret plans to fuck everyone else just like Dune. 

Life was much simpler when Mary left her briefcase at the airport and Lloyd and Harry traveled across the country to return it. 

If they opened the briefcase and it was full of Nvidia chips the movie would have sucked ass.  ",wallstreetbets,https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bjvih0/after_all_that_shit_talk_you_guys_are_posting/,2024-03-20 22:12:41,0.09551282051282053,0.45801282051282044,0.078,0.128,0.8622

Is Vertiv (VRT) a Good Growth Story Because They Have Water Cooling Solved - instead of the other guy,"It's Not a DD but a discussion and wondering if anyone has been following them closely.

Jensen specifically mentioned Vertiv in his [GTC analysis talk](https://video.ibm.com/recorded/133431763) which was amazing btw. It was like a bonus earnings call.

* In [2023 Vertiv was up 269%](https://www.forbes.com/sites/petercohan/2023/12/31/up-269-in-2023-vertiv-stock-could-outperform-nvidia-shares-in-2024/?sh=6c9ed3ec5e78)
* It's American based in Westerville, Ohio
* In the field of Generative AI they are the only other company other than Nvidia that went up 200% in 2023
* Jensen said at GTC that we are going to need bigger GPU's and more and more data centers - this seems to be the rack that Nvidia prefers and is using rather than SCMI
* If you're installing the racks you're also installing the networking for those NVLINK connections of 600 GPU's running as 1 giant GPU
* In December 2023 they announced they would provide cooling to Intel's Gaudi AI accelerator
* Joe Biden, Raimondo and J Pow just gave Intel 8.5 billion in funding just because America (it's a national security issue)
   * Production of Chips needs to come home
* Because their providing the racks that have water the racks also need power and they have collaborated with American Electric AEP Power to implement the microgrid application.
   * They're providing the diesel generator backups for disaster recovery in that microgrid application
* Generative AI is going to need more water cooling.
* Sam Altman said Chips are the new currency
* Vertiv Dominates the industry - 2023 they posted better than expected results with an ambition forecast for the year
   * Earnings per share grew 126% in Q3
* SMCI seems played out
* They have a chart that looks like this

DD: Multiple reasons why Reddit will actually go up post-IPO,"Everyone is saying ""I cannot wait to short Reddit"" but if you look at the large picture many things are working in Reddit's favor to have a successful IPO. 

**1. Banks and Exchanges want a successful high-profile IPO.**

Only 151 companies went public last year. This is down significantly from 2021 when there were 1,035. 
Part of the reason for the decline is many high-profile companies that quickly fell below their IPO levels like Instacart. Investment banks make money by partnering with companies in the IPO process; Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, J.P.Morgan and Bank of America Securities are the lead underwriters for Reddit.



**2. Limited institutional interest in shorting the stock**

Very few funds or institutions are going to short the stock. As I mentioned investment banks want more IPOs so why would they short Reddit and potentially cause more companies to stay private? Additionally, after the short-squeeze that happened with Game S no fund is going to risk shorting Reddit. The risk of being burned is too high for the possible reward. Also, because Reddit is so new there are no swaps or other complex instruments available, the only way to short would be actual short-selling. Bill Ackman ran into this same issue with herbalife and got burned.

**3. Options will not be available immediately and the exchange has discretion on when to allow them.** 

Going back to my first point. The NYSE has an interest in the IPO going well. They know options will increase volatility so they will wait as long as possible before allowing options to be traded. Options are the only way 99% of retial investors can go short on a stock. Obviously, you could actually short-sell the stock but the average retail investor will not and it's not even possible on Robinhood. 

****


As I am writing this it was just announced because of strong demand the IPO will be at the top of the IPO range ($34) . Another reason Reddit will have a strong IPO.

Nothing is Making Sense with ARM Anymore,"&#x200B;

[Literally me right now \(if you saw the movie you know\)](https://preview.redd.it/vo1djaxokkpc1.png?width=1595&format=png&auto=webp&s=46ee1556b99923d672db373afaed5466ed40f45f)

So the sell-off that everyone expected did not happen in Mar 12. I thought the whole point of going public is to sell some stocks of the company to raise capital. It's hard to believe they will hold onto 90% of the stock even after the lock up, unless it has always been to plan to make only 10% of the company public tradable. Even they sell a small percentage of what they are holding, say 10% more, it will cause the available stocks on the market to double.

I can think of a few reasons why Softbank should sell. But they might be just wishful thinking from my part.

1. Keep in mind that Softbank does not benefit from the current stock price until they actually sell, because the current free float was sold to the market at IPO price.
2. PE too high. 1600 ttm, 100 forward. Are you kidding me? (inb4 ""PE does not matter in AI stocks"")
3. There are better AI stocks out there. Why would someone hold ARM over NVDA?

"The Intel DD you need, but not deserve (Part 3)"," Alright, so apparently there is still the need to clear some things up. Since many of you really despise reading, I will try to make it shorter this time.

*“BbUt wHaT AbOuT NvDa, AmD, TsM, etC”*

It is kind of embarrassing that I have to actually point this out, but yeah: just because I make the case for one company, it does not necessarily imply statements about any other company. As I pointed out in my first DD ( [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/CnOvwpbRi8](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/CnOvwpbRi8) ), the currency of the future is compute and I expect all of them to do well. Growth and cooperation are not zero sum games. However, I specifically wanted to talk about Intel being undervalued, so please refrain from trying to shove that “bUt TsM LEEDA” up my ass, as I want to keep the available space in my anus for the inevitable green INTC dildo.

*“InTeL jUsT suRvIves oN wElFarE”*  
The West wants to get back into semiconductor manufacturing, but the cost of manufacturing is cheaper in Asia. Now, every company that tries to set this up without government subsidies is at an immediate disadvantage in a global market and that needs to be compensated. This is quite easy to understand, but I’ll make it even easier: if you blow someone behind the dumpster, but the Asian dude next to you is blowing cheaper, the US government has to pay you a little extra if it wants you to keep blowing and thus prevent a blowjob-drought if Winnie the Pooh decides do withdraw his guy.

&#x200B;

Now to your most pressing issue: 

*“wHy sToCk NoT gO uP”:*

First, to all those with 0dtes, I am not even going to comment on this. There is a reason I went with shares.

Second, to all the whining paperhands:

Think about markets and who makes money in them. The US hedge fund industry makes about 200+ billion in profit a year. So, if they are not JPow who can just ejaculate 200 billion out of nothing, you might wonder where the money comes from. Does it come from their competitors who all have the same pile of Harvard jackasses for “money making”, or could it be from someone else?

  
For your convenience, I am going to cite one of them: *“From there, the only thing we have to do to use the great machine \[the market\] to take money out of other people’s pockets and give it to us, is to be better at valuation than anyone else. When they make mistakes in estimating future probability, we make money.”*  So yes, surprise surprise, success in the market is about predicting probabilities of risk/reward ratios. If you were able to read and do proper DD you’d find out that Intel has low risk due to its immense geopolitical importance and high potential reward if they can pull Gelsinger’s plan off ([https://www.techfund.one/p/intels-fall-and-gelsingers-master](https://www.techfund.one/p/intels-fall-and-gelsingers-master)). And now, you might ask yourself who is going to make money from this very beneficial ratio. 

To make the money, you need to buy and sell at some point. This is not easy for big financial institutions, as the volume that they have to buy will inevitably influence the price. For that, they have a nasty trick up their sleeves: volume and algorithms to drive stock prices. Using “free” Robinhood you serve them your order flow on a silver plate, so they know exactly what and when you are buying and selling. “Omg good upside for Intel and the stock is down, wtffff this market is so confusing yada yada I need to sell yada yada”. It is supposed to be confusing, there is no free lunch. The best time to buy is when it hurts the most, ask yourself how often you would have made a profit if you didn’t sell at your most hurtful point. And that’s where the 200 billion comes in: by using stock price to deflect your estimation of the risk/reward ratio (which may even have been correct in the beginning) to greatly influence your market decisions in their favor. So for all the people that ask “wHeN StoNk gO uP”: I can’t tell you the exact date, but I would assume as soon as the last pig has sold its position and the big boys are set. 

Tldr; the next time you use your paperhands to pull the trigger on your RH and subsequently write a whiny comment, remember: don’t get slaughtered.

Cheers

"In the near term, $RDDT is going to the moon. In the long term, Reddit as a company will collapse","Alright professors, what did we think of the Prospectus?  

Obviously, the IPO launch is slated to occur tomorrow and every moron on this sub and beyond will buy in purely out of FOMO. This will drive the price up, and the Call option lobby will keep the imbecilic bag holders clenching for weeks to come. In the short term, the price will balloon beyond all fundamental sense, and management will work tirelessly to prove the stock isn't overvalued (it is and always will be). 

Then the honeymoon will be over, and reddit will suffer the same fate as most other mainstream social media organizations. For starters, a brief once-over of their financials shows that Reddit has ran a massive deficit since inception and this will literally never change. Plus, you'll only get more censorship and heavy handed modding in order to make the platform more palatable to big-name advertisers. This pressure to scrutinize content will only chill content generation. Like it or not, people use sites like reddit to be exposed to a wilder, more unfiltered side of humanity. Pinterst and 4chan already exist, Reddit cannot pivot into something that will magically attract new users to the cite creating a miracle monetization regime. 

The golden age of Reddit has passed, if it ever existed. This IPO and the billions floated to reddit by the underwriters will never be paid back in full, long term. The pressure by shareholders upon the board to manipulate Reddit to become profitable will slowly kill the site and leave content generation stagnant through heavy-handed censorship and moderation. The desperate attempt to cling to an overvalued market price will destroy the company from the top throughout the long term.

I liked reading all the insight from people smarter than me and the regardation in the comments, thank you for that. **I'm here today to talk about the B200 because it came up a lot. What I'm going to show is that AMD will still sell a lot of MI300Xs even when it comes out.**

First let me say the B200 is great and will be the leader, and will sell a gazillions. However, for whatever reason Nvidia decided to make their stats and metrics highly misleading in their announcement, especially for laymen who don't know what the fuck they are looking at and just see big numbers and monkey brain instincts kick in. The B200 and GB200 do have a sizeable lead on the MI300X, but its not 4x or 1000x or whatever I was seeing in the comments. **The raw performance difference from MI300X to B200 is 90% for FLOPs and 51% for memory bandwidth. The B200 has 36% more transistors than the MI300X, so it is simply a larger chip (by transistor) and that accounts for a lot of the difference. AMD can scale their next chip up if they want more FLOPs and memory bandwidth too.**

Basically the issues with Nvidia's announcement boil down to 1) not revealing their methodology, 2) doing apples to oranges comparisons, and 3) giving metrics that are intentionally misleading so people watching do apples to oranges comparisons.

I'm not going to cover everything, but I will just give a quick rundown of how I got to my numbers. We are going to use these two pages:

[https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/gb200-nvl72/](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/gb200-nvl72/)

[https://www.amd.com/en/products/accelerators/instinct/mi300/mi300x.html](https://www.amd.com/en/products/accelerators/instinct/mi300/mi300x.html)

First lets define what we are talking about.

**MI300X**

The MI300X is basically like a giant GPU. Up to 8 of them fit in a big computer that goes in a rack in a datacenter. They are connected to the server using PCIE like your graphics card, but are also interconnected with each other using Infinity Fabric cables. Infinity Fabric is important because it allows the cards to bypass the CPU when transferring data from one card to another. AMD's metrics are for one card.

**GB200**

The GB200 is a giant two-rack computer. It is made up of 72 individual graphics cards and 36 CPUs. Nvidia's version of Infinity Fabric is called NVLink, and all of the 72 GPUs and 36 CPUs are all connected to one another using NVLink. This is the largest interconnection of its kind, which is the impressive part of the GB200. Nvlink also can connect multiple GB200s together so all of their GPUs can talk with one another. **This scale of Nvlink is really the killer app of the GB200, not the chips.** 

In Nvidia's marketing material, it shows metrics for one whole GB200 system and also for one GB200 ""superchip"" which includes 2 GPUs and a CPU. Superchip is intentionally misleading though, because its 3 separate chips on a board (and one is a CPU), not one big chip.

[2x GB200 \\""superchips\\"" each with 2 GPUs and 1 CPU](https://preview.redd.it/p7tbzgfz4jpc1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=532d5df2b4c2e87d88a4415d7d52aeec7d3a4474)

**B200**

The B200 is a single giant GPU. Its probably something like what each of the GPUs on the ""superchips"" are, but we don't know for sure. Either way its a single chip like the MI300X. I'm going to call the GPUs on the superchips B200s for simplicity sake.

# Nvidia's Long Green Dick Bar Charts

I've looked through all of these, and they are all almost completely meaningless other than as trend indicators. They don't tell you even what metrics are being shown other than a two word description. Forget testing methodologies and all the details needed to understand them. I can tell you that the massive NVLink setup in the GB200 is going to lead to huge efficiency and clustering improvements, but on an individual chip basis, there is not as big of a difference between the B200 and the H200 or MI300X other than size.

# Comparing apples-to-apples

The MI300X's specs are plainly available, but nvidia hasn't released all of them for the B200 yet. Nvidia does give us 10 PFLOPs per ""superchip"" of 16 bit floating point with sparsity (this is a common type of number for AI) and AMD gives us 2.61 PFLOPs per card.

https://preview.redd.it/ujbwkv675jpc1.png?width=941&format=png&auto=webp&s=56864fb260223e857a5ee840de9513cb4c1f8d5a

Remember, the ""superchip"" is actually 3 chips on a board: a CPU and two GPUs. The CPU on the GB200 superchip is probably providing a minuscule amount of FP16 compared to the GPUs, so we can just divide the number by 2 to get 5. **So that's the best metric we can get right now: 2.61 AMD vs 5 Nvidia (FP16 PFLOPs w/ sparsity) or 90% more.**

# Memory Bandwidth

For LLM inference, or what happens when you type ""tldr this wsb post:"" into chatgpt, memory bandwidth is the most important bottleneck. Nvidia gives us a comparable figure for this: 16 TB/s for 2 GPUs or 8 TB/s per B200. The MI300X has 5.3 TB/s of memory bandwidth, **so the B200 is running with 51% more memory bandwidth.**

# Yes its good, but not out of this world

The new nvidia chips coming out later this year are a solid generational move and will be great for customers. **However there is no magic, and most of their per-chip performance increase from previous nvidia chips is because they are a lot larger. The H100 and H200 are 80B transistors, the MI300X is 153B transistors, and this new B200 is 208B transistors.** There is no magic with the new B200 other than it is a lot bigger in terms of transistor count and has slightly smaller more efficient transistors.

**The real killer app of the B200 is the way it can be combined with hundreds or thousands of other B200s using NVLink. AMD does have Infinity Fabric which connects 8 GPUs, but they haven't done this scale of integration yet. However its a reasonable assumption AMD can scale Infinity Link in the same way, so this isn't putting AMD out of the question for its next generation.**

# Where does the MI300X fit in?

Read my other post for more details about the AMD value proposition, but I'll do a quick summary here. **Remember that the MI300X is probably currently the leader in performance and will be until the B200 comes out. That gives it 9 months give or take at the top.** However, it does not need to remain the leader to sell in a volume that will be a huge increase in revenue and profit for AMD. There are plenty of niches that the MI300X does fill that the B200 doesn't. For instance the MI300X does have over double the 64 bit floating point performance of the B200. 64 bit floats are used in scientific modelling but not in AI. Presumably Nvidia will release another card that competes for general compute performance, but the MI300X does both AI and large scale compute well. Also for smaller deployments that can't leverage NVLink's large scaling efficiencies, the MI300X can easily make sense. The MI300X does have a similar interconnect at 8-card scale with Infinity Fabric. Also its likely companies will pick up the MI300X simply to diversify so Nvidia doesn't have negotiating leverage on them or because they want to reduce supply chain risk. Lastly AMD can always drop the price and still have a huge profit margin. **Its easy for me to imagine a 15% AMD AI accelerator market share with the B200 existing for these reasons.**

Furthermore, none of the additions from the GB200 or B200 are serious moats for Nvidia that AMD can't cross. **AMD can scale up its chip transistor counts, add more stacks of HBM, and scale Infinity Link in the same way. The GB200 is great, but it does not represent a hurdle AMD can't cross.**",wallstreetbets,https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bjkrtt/how_nvidia_misled_you_about_the_b200_and_why_amds/,2024-03-20 14:37:00,0.15574008191355135,0.48040670780466693,0.041,0.093,0.9968

FOMC meeting will be a dud for 0dtes,"Necessary to post this since I see hundreds of chalkheads in the daily thread wanting to 0dte for FOMC meeting today. If you pay any attention to the recent data and do any reading at all, you know that the following is likely:

**Wall Street already priced in interest rate cuts being delayed until further this year after the recent CPI and PPI data release. Interest rates widely expected to hold at 5.25% for the FIFTH time.**

If you pull up the SPY chart on Robinhood (It’s the only broker that lets rigards like you play w/ options) and look at when the last meeting was on 1/31, you’ll see that:

1. JPOW had the same sentiment at the last meeting that he will most likely have today aka WAIT AND see (no cuts or raises in the near future)
2. SPY DUMPED 🟥  before pumping to $500 the next week. 

The best move is to listen to what JPOW says, and play long for the following month. If you can’t afford long term options, check out spread options. 

**TL;DR: Don’t FOMO into the meeting and buy 0dtes bc the bots are doing it. I know how desperate some of you regards are, but it’s not worth taking that $6k loan on your credit card to lose it in 5 minutes. Most likely the meeting will move the market sideways or move in a way that will lose you money (Theta decay).**

UPDATE: SPY hit over $518 so congrats if you made some money, but now it’s coming down so I wasn’t entirely wrong. Any regards who hopped into meetings and held are probably fucked. 

**UPDATE 2: DAMNNNN I WAS HELLA WRONG, CHALKHEAD DEGENS ARE WAY SMARTER THAN ME, don’t listen to me ever again**

UPDATE 3: I took my own advice and did not FOMO into SPY calls/puts today. Missed out on some big wins, but you can’t catch ‘em all.

Is Gigacloud Technology (NASDAQ: GCT) A Scam?,"I did a DD for this company last week here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bazhkv/gct\_is\_set\_to\_take\_off\_with\_earnings\_next\_week/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bazhkv/gct_is_set_to_take_off_with_earnings_next_week/)

 Today I sold all my shares. 

Long story short they missed the deadline for their 10-K after annoucning a too good to be true looking earnings result on friday which wouldn't alone have been too sus however the founder and insiders have since dumped a lot of shares in past 2 days and the market has been spooked. 

 I want to believe their numbers but I think my best assessment is this: I fucked up. Even if the numbers gets audited and it comes out okay it's not in the clear. I watched 'The China Hustle' documentary and even if KPMG China (their auditor which is not KPMG but rather a Chinese subsidiary) gives them a rubber stamp like they have done before for chinese fraud companies it will not prove anything.

If legit  it's currently one of if not the most insanely undervalued company in the world and yet their founders sold shares knowing full well the operations of the company.  There are two likely scenarios , something I don't want to say for the remote possibility of a defamation lawsuit or even they do not believe or trust their own numbers. 

I have likely been duped and am just breaking after a large gain since I initially purchased 7 weeks ago but put more at the peak the day the earnings report was released.  A guy I have been talking to who was up more on this stock 400% on Friday also sold their entire position after they pulled this stunt.

DD: RDDT Valuation Model,"  

Sup regards, 

We are under a day away from finding out whether RDDT’s IPO will ride to the moon or drill to the center of the earth. As a loser (winner?) who didn’t have enough karma to get an allocation, I’m sitting this one out. 

Right now, there are pretty compelling qualitative arguments for why the IPO will go well or poorly. The second that you think one narrative is going to get the upper hand, something from the other side pops out and makes you wonder again (such as Bloomberg saying the IPO is guiding to price at the top of its range). 

To pass the time, I thought I would run a valuation model today to throw some quant in the mix. 

I’m going to do a base-case FCF build, then play around with some bull and bear stuff. 

***Assumptions:*** 

Rf: 4.3%

Reddit Beta: unknown, but I’m going with 1.5, which I think is generous and will be higher (Meta is 1.2, pinterest is 1, and Bumble is 1.7). 

Discount rate: 11.8% (derived through CAPM, with market risk premium of 5%)

G rate: 3% (again, I’m being generous here, but you can check my sensitivity tables) 

FCF Build, base case (literally just what the analysts built ripped from S-1 and reasonable expectations) 

TLDR: not looking good, still negative (207.5) in FY 28. Wild to have an adjusted EBITDA number that is still negative, fuck. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cvnzork6iipc1.png?width=998&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d2014bd4e953176556fd3e7f1f3ab75359a7d48

Oof, negative share price. Need to up that FCF cash money Spez. Obviously they won’t have a negative share price, but this leads the more discerning regard to wonder if they are trying to make him or her into a bagholder with this IPO. 

***Bull DCF Scenario*** 

Now let’s say that some AMAZING things happen to reddit instead. Revenue growth for this two decade old app accelerate to 25% YoY now through 2028, adjusted EBITDA margins expand to about half of what Meta has by 2028 (again, super rosy), and Beta comes in cooler than I thought driving the discount rate down to 11%: 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xz4ercb9iipc1.png?width=1090&format=png&auto=webp&s=baed9563e2271852e53afed5a64a34561b05bf90

Even with this very positive bull case, the projected price is only $12.71, representing a discount of (60.9%)- nice- to the estimation of the offer price. 

The base case is so bearish that there is no point making a more bearish case than having a negative share price. 

***Bull Base Exit Multiple Method:*** 

This speaks mostly for itself, and helps to show us more of the upside if this stock starts to pump due to inflated multiple/ market mania, but still lots of downside valuation pressure.

***Quick and Dirty Comp Valuation:***

Since revenue is the only thing of RDDT’s that is positive, the only sensical multiple is TEV/Rev. Based on a comp set of Meta, Pinterst, and Snap, the Hi/Lo for this is 42.2 and 7.3.

***Conclusion, TL;DR:*** 

IMO, this opinion depends on the regard energy on opening day. I do like the inverse WSB theory here since most are so bearish, but in my nuts I feel like it will pop and then bleed much like HOOD did. I’m not dumb enough to short a meme stock, but given the quant valuations, lack of lockup period, and shaky market, this is a no from me dog. On the other hand, if we drop to teens/ low teens, I could be very persuaded by some delicious FDs or LEAPs.

ARRY - The perfect acquisition for a massive carbon offset,"Carbon credits, also called carbon offsets, are a tool used to fight climate change. They are essentially tradable permits that represent the right to emit a certain amount of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases.

Here's how it works:

* **Emission reduction projects:** Organizations like businesses or governments can invest in projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These projects can involve things like renewable energy, planting trees, or capturing methane from landfills.
* **Verification and credits:** If a project meets strict standards and actually reduces emissions, it gets verified by a third party. Then, credits are issued, with one credit typically representing one ton of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) reduced.
* **Buying and selling credits:** Companies that can't easily reduce their own emissions can buy carbon credits from these projects. This allows them to essentially offset their emissions by funding reductions elsewhere.

There are two main types of carbon credit programs:

* **Cap-and-trade:** In this system, governments or regulators set a limit on the total amount of emissions allowed (the cap). Companies get a certain number of credits (permits to pollute) which decline over time. They can buy extra credits from those who have reduced their emissions more than required.
* **Voluntary market:** Businesses or individuals can also choose to buy carbon credits directly to offset their emissions, even if they aren't required to by law.

Carbon credits are a debated topic, but they offer a way to:

* **Incentivize emissions reduction:** Companies that can reduce emissions can profit by selling credits, while those who pollute more have to pay.
* **Fund green projects:** The money from carbon credits can be used to invest in renewable energy, reforestation, and other projects that fight climate change.

**$ARRY - Array Technologies Inc**

They design and manufacture special mounting systems for solar panels that track the sun throughout the day. This increases the amount of energy the panels can produce compared to fixed-tilt mounting systems.

Here are some key details about Array Technologies:

* **Industry:** Renewable Energy Equipment Manufacturing [https://pitchbook.com/profiles/company/95714-29](https://pitchbook.com/profiles/company/95714-29)
* **Products:** Solar trackers, single-axis trackers, solar mounting systems [https://pitchbook.com/profiles/company/95714-29](https://pitchbook.com/profiles/company/95714-29)
* **Headquarters:** Albuquerque, New Mexico [https://arraytechinc.com/](https://arraytechinc.com/)
* **Public company:** Traded on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the symbol ARRY

**My Thesis**

Even though ARRY reported a 90% increase in quarterly profit and a 20% increase in quarterly income the stock reacted anemically. Printing a day or two of upside before it was sold off. The stock recently put in a bottom on 3/18/24.  A significant amount of their expanded income came from green energy credits funded in part by the Inflation Reduction Act.  Call them whatever you want. ALL government spending is loaded with pork barreling, and a significant amount of capital is going to flow to the green energy sector. That won't be a one-shot or short-term thing. It will grow and grow.  ARRY is going to benefit, and their suppressed stock price makes them a sexy acquisition for any cash-rich fossil fuel giant or tech giant. Both are going to need carbon offsets to continue their business's status quo into the future.

I think a fair price for a buyout is north of $4.5 billion.

"What Musk predicted for Tesla’s market cap, seems more likely to be happening to Nvidia. ","https://insideevs.com/news/617495/tesla-could-be-worth-more-than-apple-saudi-aramco-combined-musk/

What Musk predicted for Tesla, about their market cap higher than Apple and Saudi Aramco combined, it seems more likely to happen to Nvidia. 

Jensen in his capacity as CEO is not paid billions in salary, so not sure how he keeps himself motivated, constantly creating value for NVDA’s shareholders. He also owns less than 10% of Nvidia shares, and he is not worried of losing control of the company, and asking board for a big pay package. 

In my opinion, if anyone in the world deserves a US$50b pay package, it is Jensen.

The technology powered by Nvidia chips is going to be felt through many industries, across many countries.

How NVDA could become a $20T company,"So if I understand this correctly, nVidia is by far the leader in GPUs and can't make chips fast enough to sell them to everyone in the world who wants to create an AI. Furthermore, for any real competition to show up would take 5-10 years for them to design, create and manufacture a competitive chip. Is this correct? Because if this is correct, and now that we know they too are working on an AI...

Why not just stop selling chips?

That would cripple literally everyone else in the game and leave them as the ONLY company with proper AI technology for the next 5 or more years. That's a lifetime in AI terms. Not only that, but they can manufacture all the compute they need while doing so. Within 2 months they become the only company that can produce an AI worth using. Now they own 100% of the AI market with literally no competition in sight.

They win. GG.

Edit: How is this getting so much hate? lol. Do you regards not get it??? Look, if NVDA is the only play in town, and they keep all the compute they make, they'll be able to develop their AI a lot faster than we've seen so far. We are talking AGI within 5 years max. If they are first to AGI, the clone every MSFT software and offering, thereby driving MSFT out of business and taking it all over. Add that 3T market cap to NVDA. Same with META. Swallow them whole. GOOG, eat 'em up. They can continue to devour dozens and dozens of companies by simply having their AI recreate every online service, only better. Then they use their AI to perfect embodied AI and then use them to build anything they want. McDonalds? Gone. TSLA? Gone. V? Gone. Eventually, they rule every market for virtually free because robots don't eat or sleep or complain or ask for money. nVidia becomes the only company on earth. 20T? Shit, I undershot.

Micron Earnings - Bullish ,"Micron's (MU) earnings are today (3/20) after the bell, I'm feeling pretty bullish, here’s my reasons: 

First off, there's been an increase in analyst upgrades, suggesting some solid performance is anticipated.

The growth in AI tech is a huge driver for increased demand in DRAM. AI applications need to process huge datasets at lightning speed, and that's pushing the demand for high-speed memory through the roof.

Also, I’ve been reading DRAM prices starting to climb. As supply tightens and demand from AI continues to expand, it's setting up a pretty favorable scenario for Micron’s pricing.

Even though I'm bullish about Micron, I do have some concerns: 

- They have heavy competition. 

- There's likely somewhat of a slowdown in their consumer segments. This could be because people are cutting back on discretionary spending or possibly holding off on upgrading their PCs, possibly waiting for the new wave of ""AI PCs."" 

- I'm concerned that any positive outcomes might already be reflected in Micron's current stock price, which could limit the upside from the earnings report.

I could easily see it going either way. What do you all think? Anyone holding for earnings tomorrow? 

I’ve got a mild 6 x 110c exp. 7/19 with an average cost of $4.53. 

UPDATE 3/21 (Day after earnings): Sold contracts today for $11.52 and made ~153% profit. Could likely run higher, but I’d rather take profit and avoid any type of drop in the price.

Looks like the CORN short squeeze is on...,"Food prices have adjusted for inflationary downpressure and the effects have not been realized in one of the key staples of our economy. CORN

While everyone has their head in the sky with pie dreams of AI, let's not forget what feeds America. What fuels growth. What drives the economy.

CORN call volume is picking up rapidly. It's been massively shorted and suppressed but it's about to spring like a coil and cause a short squeeze that will send a huge ripple across the broader market.

I also believe that this will be the catalyst that will re-trigger the squeeze on all the meme stocks.

Managing risk should be NORMAL,"I don't mean this to come off preachy. I myself have lived a life of stock market sin, but I've come to the light and I want others to see the truth as well. 

In this sub we have come to glorify massive gains and colossal losses 📉.  The typical person here would seem to have a 5-10k dollar Robinhood account, which they eagerly are willing to risk most of on a random earnings event, overnighting weeklies, or dca-ing 0dte against the market until their account reaches -99%. 

What if it didn't have to be this way? What if someone with a 5-10k cash account could average 100-200 bucks a day in gains rather than just going all or nothing? They would only take 25-100 trading days to double up with a more measured approach to trading. 

How? Well, how about for starters: 

1) Weeklies and 0dte are for scalping, not swinging. Yes, when you see COIN or NVDA or whatever the fuck stock you suck yourself off to has a good setup on the intraday: you scalp that shit. You buy a weekly and sit there until you've made a little money and you throw the option back into the sea 🌊 after like 10-30 minutes.  



2) Swinging has a clean technical setup. So, say we want to enter a trade against QQQ in this bull market. The trend is already against it. Would it make more sense to enter short if it was stalling out at like 445 where you would have a closer logical stop, or 434 where you're just jerking yourself off hoping the last 6 months of trend support will break? Praise God. 👏  



3) You can accept a loss and you know where you'll take it when you enter a trade. A general rule I've learned in the futures trading community is you never will let a single day take out more than 3 days of your average gains. Preferably less, but we are in the business of risking it for the biscuit so sometimes shit happens. Say you made 200 for the last 5 days, and the next day you get fucked for 600, you're still up 400 and your mental has probably taken a hit but it's better than if you took your account from 5k to 12k overnight then toileted the entire account dca-ing spy puts against an uptrend day. Then you just won't be feeling good about shit for a couple months rather than a day or two.

Inflation is Transitory,"As yes, the favorite slogan of our God, daddy Jpow. He said this so many times. 

*TRANSITORY*

That was his favorite word for a long time. I remember drinking games where people would take a shot everytime he said that word during a speech. Now our fabled God of funny Money, Prince of the drunk sailors, has a new term:

*CONFIDENCE*

I don't know how many motherfucking times I have heard this guy say the word confident, confidence, or some phrase like, ""we must be confident with the data."" WELL GUESS WHAT? Last week's data was anything but ""confident."" It was bad, it was mixed, inflation is up, consumer confidence (haha) is down, literally the definition of confusing. 

I don't know what that means, and I sure as fuck know Jpow doesn't know what that means. So that's not exactly confidence, I guess we will see if the fed is going to Do what it has said it's going to do. 

Now im not a homobear, I have calls on palantir and PayPal, and buys on US100(forex) but I did hedge with some spy puts that expire Friday.

Any advice ? {a little bit of Rant please ignore},"
I keep loosing so much on 0 dte SPY options. It’s just happened 3 or 4 times so far and those have been the biggest losses ever. I have been consistently trading from a long time. I do follow all the news. Understand all the options strategies, and a lot of finance terms. I listen to fed calls every week, listen to podcasts, earnings calls. And I can guess direction pretty well too.

Last few weeks I have been sleeping less and less but wake up every day an hour before markets do analysis and I am right on the  general direction at least 60% -70% of the time. I bet calls on Appl, google, when they were at their lows but sold out at small profits. Next day google runs 6% up. 

I trade well on high volatility days. Make some profit and stop. And out of nowhere, I don’t know what happens, as soon as i go into a position bigger than I ever normally do on a 0dte markets tend to go tits up in the other direction. 

And the only SPY/ qqq positions I lost big were puts at 0dte. The first time I lost over 30k in a single day spy went up my option was worth .06 and I was ITM again in 2020. And now I keep buying puts and it just runs the other direction. 


 Like today’s rally, why ? I know markets go up and down. Today, it’s not just NVDA, every sector went up and the inflows too were pretty intense. like my NvDA calls today I exited at a loss even as the price went up. 

I don’t know why end up in this position after going through so much trash analysts interviews and readings. I miss out on big profits and take 90% of full losses . 

Do you guys never trade big naked option positions. I see some people make wins out of literal crazy bets I want to get fricking 50% win a couple of times. Where you buy something and it goes in your direction not against you.

Is my fear overblown?,"When markets fall, it's typically the most speculative asset (ie BTC) that gets dumped first. If you've seen the movie Margin Call, Jeremy Irons said the way to win is to be smarter or cheat, and he doesn't cheat, so it's helluva easier to just be first. 

Some of you know I've been losing my ass on puts the last couple of weeks, about 10k combined on NVDA and others that ended up worthless. I've in the past few days sold more than 50% of my holdings so now I'm 3/4 cash and 1/4 securities. The cash is making ~4.97% on SPAXX so it's not like it isn't gaining but I'm chickening out because I've seen this before - and no I'm not talking about forward PE or anything rational but rather the overall feeling of a feeding frenzy. 

I'm holding TSM (also calls for 5/19), INTC (and LEAPS), IONQ, RIVN, SOXL ($21 avg), BA (and calls for Jan '25) HOOD, and SOFI. Plan to close all my CSP before JP opens his mouth tomorrow.

NVDA will drop to 840 tomorrow,"1. The FOMC meeting is going to be extremely hawkish. No rate cut is coming until August at the earliest and this is due to the insane inflation we’re seeing both in the states and globally. Japan for the first time in 17 years has raised interest rates which will no doubt raise the cost of goods imported here, making inflation even worse domestically. This is a clear pattern we are seeing globally that will impact prices paid in the US

2. The market has lost enthusiasm for NVDIA in the current economic climate. They had one of the most stellar conferences where they announced they have their hands in every industry, where Wall Street had even raised price targets on them, and what happens? Everyone dumped the stock due to fears stemming from the FOMC meeting. Right now the market is pricing in 3 rate cuts but that just isn’t possible with the rate of inflation we are at right now. The entire market will tank tomorrow once retail pulls their head out of their behinds and acknowledges the facts 

3. I bought calls

4. Even with all the good news it’s still months away from actually generating revenue for NVDIA. With high interest rates companies are better off buying bonds than trying to invest in building AI in a desperate attempt to cut costs. Without sufficient capital, big orgs will struggle to pay the hefty price for the newer Blackwell chips (which they won’t even be able to buy until the summer). As such NVIDA’s revenue will fall in the current environment and wall street knows this.

NYTs: Saudi Arabia Plans $40 Billion Push Into Artificial Intelligence,"Summary of article: 

Saudi Arabia plans to create a $40 billion fund for investing in artificial intelligence, making it the world's largest A.I. investor. The move reflects the country's ambition to diversify its economy and establish global influence. Discussions with Silicon Valley's Andreessen Horowitz indicate the fund's potential partnerships. A.I. investments are in high demand globally, with Saudi Arabia eyeing tech startups, chip makers, and data centers. The initiative may kick off in the second half of 2024, positioning Saudi Arabia and Andreessen Horowitz as key players in the A.I. landscape. Despite past challenges in tech investing, Saudi Arabia's recent moves signal its renewed interest and growing influence in the technology sector.

DD: I DD'd the nvidia run up last year ($250->$700) and was right. Now I have a new prediction,"Here's my nvidia DD from last year (NVDA was $250 and I predicted $700 within a year): [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/13lb98n/dd\_nvda\_to\_700\_by\_this\_time\_next\_year/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/13lb98n/dd_nvda_to_700_by_this_time_next_year/)

Last week I timed the exit on my BTC and QQQ holdings fairly well. **Now I'm setting my sights on a new horizon: AMD**

AMD is sort of like the nice ugly step sister of hot bae nvidia. Everyone ""likes"" her, but she doesn't get invited to parties and no one takes her seriously. Right now reminds me of Ryzen 1. When AMD was $12, I predicted AMD's stock price would triple in the next two years due to how well the architecture fit with datacenter needs. I posted my DD here and was right. It took most people by surprise because at the time Intel had 99% of the datacenter CPU market. Now we look at $180+ AMD price. I think we are once again going to be surprised by su bae and co.

I'll get to my evidence that AMD will exceed expectations yet again, but first I want to address some obvious points of skepticism.

1. **Firstly AMD's seemingly absurd P/E ratio of 364:** I'm going to show that not only is AMD's revenue going to go up by an absurd amount in the next year, but also its net income margin. Nvidia operates at around 50% income right now and AMD is operating at around 20% right now. That gap is going to close considerably in the next year. I'm estimating AMD will reach around 35-40% net income. On top of that AMD will grow revenue by 50% in the next year (wishful thinking would say as high as 70% more revenue) exclusively due to AI accelerators. This will all lead to considerably more realistic P/E ratio.
2. **Next Nvidia's control on the market:** The evidence points to this being a detriment to Nvidia. AI companies are looking to diversify from Nvidia because they don't want to be vendor-locked, Nvidia has a 1 year back order on its top AI accelerators, and Nvidia's massive profit margin makes it easy to undercut their price. Furthermore, CUDA dominance is highly exaggerated today. I use this stuff every day, and ROCm is absolutely production ready, especially for large companies who have the staff to optimize for it. The people who say ROCm sucks haven't used it in a while -- AMD is working on it at a break neck pace.

# Now on to my DD

The debate about AMD's price largely boils down to its newest AI accelerator's value (the MI300X) versus Nvidia's current AI accelerator (the H100). AI accelerators are now most of the accelerator market (including GPUs), and also have the highest profit margins by far, so they are basically 80% of the valuation on these companies' stock prices. Yes the H200 and the new GB200 are coming out soon for Nvidia, but the MI300X has a timing lead on them which enables it to get some foothold. So for the moment, its MI300X vs H100 for companies deciding what to buy.

**Accelerator Value:** Reviews for the MI300X are going to come out imminently (within a few weeks), and we will begin seeing hard evidence for its value proposition then. I have spent a lot of time on older AMD cards analyzing their performance versus big green. My findings are that generally AMD is capable of being as fast or faster than Nvidia, but most open source projects are optimized better for Nvidia so in the real world AMD has a performance disadvantage. However in the case of the MI300X, its raw performance is so large over an H100, it will likely produce slightly better real world performance. Also the MI300X is selling for around $25k per card (you can buy it right now [https://www.thinkmate.com/system/a+-server-8125gs-tnmr2](https://www.thinkmate.com/system/a+-server-8125gs-tnmr2)) where the H100 is around $40k, so companies will be looking at benchmarks in a couple weeks that point to the MI300X being slightly faster and considerably less expensive.

**Nvidia supply constraint:** Nvidia has a back order of around a year for their latest AI accelerators. This means if a company needs to immediately purchase accelerators for a new project, they simply can't from Nvidia at scale. AMD's order books are currently open, but probably filling fast for this reason.

**Announced customers:** Meta is going to be the largest customer for the MI300X. They have indirectly announced that they will purchase up to almost half of their 600k accelerators this year from AMD ([https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/02/meta\_ai\_chips/](https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/02/meta_ai_chips/)). This customer alone will add 25% to AMD's revenue and improve their profit margin from 20% to roughly 28%. MS has already started deploying the MI300X on Azure and Oracle has announced they will launch VMs with them, but neither has announced numbers. Who won't be using AMD? OpenAI has a multi-year contract with nvidia, and Google uses their own proprietary TPU.

**AI accelerator headwind:** The AI accelerator market is expected to have a CAGR of over 20% for the next 5+ years. This means there will be continued supply constraints that incentivize diversifying hardware. New players inherently have an advantage because of this. It just happens that AMD is the next new player to be mature and scaled enough for widespread adoption. Yes Intel and startups will probably do fine also, but AMD is seeing ridiculous growth at this very moment that hasn't appeared on their earnings report yet (fulfillment for the MI300X did not ramp up until roughly January). There is such a ridiculous amount of demand in this ai accelerator market that everyone in it will grow.

# My price target: $450 AMD

After doing some napkin math on the market, I think it is reasonable for AMD to acquire 15-20% of the AI accelerator market by the end of the year, up from an inconsequential market share before. This includes speculation about AMD's product competitiveness, their ability to scale, the customers that will be interested in buying AMD, market growth, and new Nvidia product launches. Extrapolating that marketshare into net income by using a rough margin per card and using Nvidia's P/E ratio as a baseline model, translates to an AMD fair stock price of around $450 by the end of the year.

AMD's price will start to go up after the MI300X reviews come out and rumors of their customer acquisitions come in. The May earnings report will be where it starts to appear on their books, but they are still ramping up right now and Q2 is where we will see the largest earnings growth.

**My positions are: $190 6/21C and $200 10/18C**

"How Google ""Exposed"" 500k Users Data and Get Away With It","I bet all of you heard about that one Google+ scandal, with their data privacy bomb which exposed hundreds of thousands of users data.

For those who are new to Google somehow, that's the deal: in 2018, WSJ reported that Google found a ""glitch"" in Google+ earlier that year, which affecting data security. Between 2015 and March 2018, this glitch allowed outside developers access to almost 500k (!!) users personal data.

And despite discovering this issues in March 2018, Google didn't inform anybody about that to avoid regulatory issues. Simply - they didn't want ""problems with regulators which can affect their reputation"" as they said.

They were hit with may suits due to this, and finally they [resolved with $350M](https://11thestate.com/cases/alphabet-investor-settlement) the one for the investors over stock drops, so if you invested in Google you can check it I guess.

Actually, I think that Google+ was over even back then, in precovid times, they didn't have any features which weren't improved by others already and in mooore handy way. So, they didn't even have a chance to compete with any other platforms so it was kinda predetermined for them.

"Don't expect CPI to cool off any time soon with oil prices going up, and seasonal high demand for oil around the corner.","It could be a hot summer for CPI.

WTI crude oil is currently hovering around $83.

Russian refineries are getting blown up. We still have a middle east crisis, Houthis targeting shipping lanes.

This while the typical high seasonal demand for oil is coming up:

All this while Saudi Arabia wants to boost its revenue for its big crazy projects and OPEC is looking at maintaining lower output to keep prices high, the electric car revolution is being delayed, and the US is aiming to replenish its oil reserves by year's end.

&#x200B;

On the positive, or at least in terms of forces pushing in the other direction for lower prices, China, one of the big oil consumers, is going through a recession. Which means much lower consumerism and lower oil demand.

Uncle Joe has an election. He knows the average voter isn't too bright and will think he's the cause of oil prices. So he's gonna have to pull a trick up his sleeves to keep prices down. Unfortunately, there's not a whole lot of tricks available to him. Especially with oil reserves partially depleted, and his promises to replenish reserves, that have backed him into a corner.

Unrelated to energy, but relevant to CPI, a housing market crash (courtesy of Florida) could have a ripple effect that could cool off CPI, and potentially bring it all back to Fed target.

Is BTC the canary in the coal mine?,"This is a bit of a shower thought but if we are looking for signs of a pull back in equity markets I do wonder if using BTC as a signal has any value.

&#x200B;

BTC hit its peak of about 62.5k in mid November of 2021

Towards the end of January 2022 it had crashed all the way down to 35k, a 44% drop. 

It would continue to fall until November of 2022 and stagnated at the bottom until January of 2023. 

It would not make an ATH again until mid March 2024.

&#x200B;

The S&P hit it's peak on December 30th of 2021 at 4800. 

By end of January it had only dropped to \~4300, a 10.5% drop. 

The S&P hit it's bottom in mid October 2022. The market did not languish here and by November it had already risen 14% from its low. 

It made a new ATH late January 2024.

&#x200B;

If we accept the idea that BTC is a volatile speculative and risky asset this all makes total sense. Risky assets are the first to be dumped when a bearish turn around in markets is happening. They are the last to be bought back into when markets turn bullish again. So the fact that BTC dumped first and hardest and then lagged the market all through the bull run makes perfect sense. 

From what I can see looking back to November/ December 2021 Jpow was beginning to signal a turn. The fed had stopped buying bonds, and by December was talking about a change in strategy to rate hikes. So this all lines up with investors feeling the changing of the winds and dumping risky speculative asset classes. 

&#x200B;

So the question is can you use BTC as an early warning sign that equity markets are about to take a dive?

I think its a valid enough thing to consider. The current top in BTC and the rather large drop it's taken over the past week (-12% over past 5 days) all while equity markets trade sideways at ATH and certain leading stocks (NVDA) sit at the top of their chart patterns is concerning. A pullback has felt inevitable for a while now in the S&P but timing seems like a fools errand. 

The BTC drop is by no technical means a bear market for BTC yet. It would really depend where you want to view your areas of support. Do you call 62k support? 51k? 43-39k?  I have no clue how you would evaluate BTC other than TA since it literally has nothing else going on but price movement. 

If you continued to see BTC plummet downwards you could view it as a bearish signal for equity markets. I know you guys love trading short term shit off sentiment so i'll leave an absolutely regarded TLDR.

&#x200B;

$FDX & $AMZN Partnership,"Hello all,

From what I’ve read there is a rumor of an Amazon and FedEx partnership. The rumor started supposedly in the WSJ, but being it is a paid news source that consistently changes its story titles and headings I cannot take it into account without acknowledging the bias behind it. They want clicks and subscribers, I think that’s obvious to most of us. Other sources with advertisements have picked up on the story and continue to regurgitate the story.

What I cannot understand is how Amazon would be a beneficiary in this transaction if they already spent large sums of money in the past to have a fleet independent to that of UPS and FedEx. UPS bought out Happy Returns, so return locations already are expanding, but FedEx’s revenue does not come from doing returns. Amazon even has the logistics and capital to pay an Amazon employee or contractor to go collect packages from customers’ houses likely at a lower dollar compared to paying third-parties.

Does anyone have any input on why FedEx would benefit from Amazon allowing them to handle returns or why Amazon would take a deal such as this?",wallstreetbets,https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1biljyv/fdx_amzn_partnership/,2024-03-19 10:26:56,0.07410714285714286,0.4773809523809524,0.021,0.134,0.9652

"These calls could be 500 Baggers. Turn $1,000 into $500,000","Okay, I already know I'm gonna get a bunch of hate for this post, so I only ask that you read the entire  post  before replying. I honestly think this could be the biggest trading opportunity since Jan 2021.

In October 2021 $DWAC announced they were gonna merge with a brand new Donald Trump Media Company called Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG). It's not just Truth Social but an entire company that will have paid video streaming, etc. Traders went crazy and the price shot up 1700% to $175. Then the SEC opened a lawsuit against them trying to block the merger and the stock crashed. After almost 3 years, the SEC finally cleared all the lawsuits and approved the merger. **$DWAC is holding a shareholder meeting on Friday, March 22nd to vote to approve the business combination. If the vote passes, the stock will change to ticker symbol $DJT on Monday, March 25th and make its public debut on the NASDAQ.**

**MAGA people are crazy.** When Donald Trump announced Trump NFTs they sold out within minutes. When he launched those Trump shoes they also sold out within minutes and are now selling for 10k+. 99% of the general public has NO IDEA a brand new Trump stock $DJT is going to be making its debut on Monday. Imagine Trump ringing the bell to the NYSE and pumping $DJT. And every news outlet in America covering it. Do you honestly think the MAGA people won't dump their entire 401ks, IRAs, etc and put everything into $DJT?

The daily volume right now is basically nothing, and when this gets mass media coverage when it turns into $DJT it may explode. And if you think Trump (who is gonna own most of it) is gonna dump his shares on everyone....he probably will....but there's a 6 month lock-up period. That means no insiders, including Trump, can sell any shares until 6 months of $DJT going public. It also has a 200% borrow rate going into the merger meaning any inflow of volume will make for a giant move.

Most new companies that go public don't have weekly options or any options at all. When Grindr went public it shot up 900% on the first day. A stock tied to Donald Trump Jr shot up 300% on merger day just because of Trump Jrs name. Yes they sold off later on but this is a trade not a long-term investment. $DWAC has weekly options because it's been around so long. All it takes is $DWAC going slightly above the old ATH and you can turn $1,000 into $500,000 with far OTM $90 calls. **This would be the best trade since Jan 2021. All it takes is volume coming from nationwide media coverage and MAGA cult buying and the trade will work.**

Here are my positions: March 28th $50, $60, $70, $80 and $85 calls -

If there’s one thing we can count on, fixing broken dicks is pretty fucking recession, bubble, and inflation resistant. After all, there’s a lot of em out there (fuckin microplastics) and a lot of inelastic demand to fix em.

Talk about selling umbrellas in a rainstorm, HIMS is long broken dicks etc. They’re a telemedicine company that’s dishing out the goods. They’ve streamlined health services by linking you to a doc, flipping scripts, filling em, and shipping to your doorstep. All from their digital platform. Convenient.

Long dismissed as unprofitable, HIMS kept churning and just reported their first GAAP profitable quarter (2023 Q4). Also, increased their 2024 projections for 37% Y/Y revenue growth (first full year of positive earnings). The market responded with its own single day 30% boner and everyone jumping in. Stock refuses to fall.

HIMS is running on near zero debt with $221 million in cash. They are projected to generate at least $90 mil FCF in 2024, $165M 2026, $243M 2026. 

Runnin the math, HIMS is trading at 3.6x EV/Rev. If management beats like they always do then $1.2B revenue in 2024 implies it should trade at $21. For $1.8B in 2026, that’s $32. Based on EPS forecast, probably should trade higher.

They’ve grown gross profit by 1500% over the last 4 years while achieving a gross margin of 83%. Straight extinguishing my ED right now just thinking about that.

But this deserves a further breakdown. In 2023, they made $827M revenue BUT $446M of their operating cost is marketing. That’s over 50% of opex. Now as much as I perk up to an ad promising to supercharge my dick, that’s a pretty soft cost. They can pull the marketing lever at any moment and poof, meet or exceed earnings without interrupting dick pill delivery. 

**The Sticky Business**

HIMS is overtaking the market of telemedicine. Someone’s gotta choke out the clowns in the space. If there was ever a question of the big swinging dick in the industry, I think its become pretty fucking clear. 

https://preview.redd.it/94xocdicj7pc1.jpg?width=976&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8628c82c55233ac27e45a60953e32d0eaeb5095e

HIMS is clutching #1 by ensuring the stickiest of subscribers. They’ve reported 48% Y/Y subscriber growth for a total of 1.5 million customers. Customer retention then fuels recurring revenue streams. Revenues and customers just refuse to stop.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/uqcw0tnnbapc1.jpg?width=508&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1dea996f40684bd638e7100cb01aed349407103c

Makes sense though, no one wants to hang out with a bunch of geriatrics in a smelly waiting room across town. 

In part, HIMS is achieving this with deployment of AI (Medmatch) that generates personalized care solutions. Medmatch can churn through more patient data in a single day to make recommendations then 10 doctors can in a lifetime. These personalized programs entangle customers in the services that motivates them to stay subscribed.

Overall, 30% of subscribers choose one or more personalized products. As the engine becomes stronger, the stickier the retention becomes. 

Implementation of AI and the digital platform also enables scalability. Which is nice because US Health & Wellness achieved a valuation of $1.2 trillion whereas HIMS represents $3.1 bil of that. That's a shitload of growth potential. Particularly when you consider the CDC calculates that 37% of US adults are using telemedicine.

New customer opportunities and entanglement are expected to continue to grow. There are several key markets HIMS is developing BUT pay attention to “weight”. What we’re talking about is GLP-1 (Ozempic/Wegovy). Fuck yes, that’s huge. The GLP-1 market is undergoing a nuclear chain reaction–demand blasting through supply. Soon brought to you on your doorstep by HIMS.

**Boner Army Assembling**

So based on multiples, it’s easy to see how HIMs should trade at $21-$32 and tutes know it. They have been consistently accumulating equity in HIMS. Last reporting showed tutes owned 61% of the shares outstanding (134 mil). This is pre-Q4 earnings which blew expectations out of the water so that accumulation has likely grown even further.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bpku0refj7pc1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=884198bff8a3d3e1fc19ed6d6decad723a164f7a

With insiders owning 50 mil shares, 36 mil shares are available to us normies (17% shares outstanding). Meanwhile, short sellers finding themselves trapped (13M shares) as tutes gobble HIMS up. Now listen, this isn’t some stupid sQe3zE play but it does represent compounding buying pressure as shorts dig out. If cringing, revert to valuation above and ignore. Doesn’t matter enormously.

**Tic Tac Fire Sale**

Bear with me non-regards, MMs price options based on volatility. You take the bet they’re under estimating volatility and they take the other side. Cool. Problem is, they make and change the rules of the game. 

MMs force the market to pay for their fabricated volatility premium (IV) not what an equity has historically realized (HV). By setting IV above HV, MMs synthetically tilt the odds in their favor. Just like anything, works until it doesn’t.

HIMS has traded with relatively calm options volume. So business has been tough for MMs. To help with that, they’ve been fishing with low premiums. Once hooked, they’d hard dump after every earnings to cash in. It worked pretty well for a while. 

But Feb 26th, HIMS says hold my beer. They set off a bomb with earnings and forecast revisions. Equity pumps 30%+ as tutes FOMO and MMs are suddenly underwater in their superglued Titan sub. Things looking dicey for them as realized volatility (blue line) has flipped aggressively against their IV dump (yellow line). HV refuses to reverse.

&#x200B;

So their shitty carbon fiber submarine is crackling and MMs are clenching their buttholes. Hoping this one last expedition can survive the depths of volatility before implosion. MMs last defense is play dead to try to save themselves. Premiums are on a fire sale as they try to squash HV before a runaway gamma sitch. Stas show it doesn’t get much cheaper to scoop up.

**I’m Losing Count of Dick References**

*Bonus points for counting the dick references cuz I lost count.* With that, I think it's time to wrap. We got some sexy fundamentals justifying a higher valuation and asymmetric options pricing. Got to overtly but appropriately machine gun dick references--pretty clear HIMS is memeable. All that’s left is to say, I’m ready to see where these sex chews can take us. Hold on to your dicks, $HIMS is going on a ride. Peace.

**Positions:**

**TL;DR**

$HIMS is quickly becoming the #1 telemedicine company dishing out dick pills etc. Choking out all the competition. Consistently rising revenue and earnings (now positive). Trajectory continues upward; implying a valuation of $21-$32 even though its trading sub $16. Tutes own 60%+ of the shares and won’t stop buying. Stock keeps mooning.

I went all in on NVDA,"Mar 19 today should be a super Green Day according to chart analysis Lol. But let’s see. 

GTC day 1 failed to make a difference in investors’ understanding of the immense scope of applicability. Investors seem to be still thinking they are being their own competition by making a chip 1000x faster in 8 years. But, innovation will keep them above anyone else even trying to reach. Which is a plus for the company. 

And the technology is something like energy in the industrial era, software in the Information Age, data in the cloud. In earlier generations we COULD not create these big LLM because of chips being less powerful. The creation of better chips will only lead to plentiful new opportunities. 
Google, apple, to palantir, siemens, Boeing, to your local government, state and federal governments. Heck countries and all the big and small players will need such powerful chips to solve complex problems.

Bullish takeaway from todays GTC $NVDA,"Today's GTC may have been challenging for many to grasp, but that's actually a positive indicator. This isn't a trivial matter—it marks a significant leap in technological advancement, arguably the most groundbreaking achievement humanity has ever witnessed.

Let's delve into the details. Training large language models has become a focal point for companies like $AMZN, $META, and $NOW. The previous generation of chips, exemplified by the Grace Hopper Superchip, was undoubtedly impressive. However, Blackwell surpasses it by a staggering margin—it's 30 times faster and more powerful. This technological leap places the competition even further behind, effectively setting them back by another decade.

An often-overlooked aspect is the indispensability of Blackwell for cloud service providers (CSPs). The sheer scale of the task—training the Large Language Model (LLM) with previous technology—highlights the monumental significance of Blackwell. Simply put, there's no viable alternative, and this sets a new benchmark, reminiscent of the ""Steve Jobs"" era where innovation reigned supreme.

Financially speaking, Blackwell comes at a premium, and demand is already sky-high among major corporations globally. The price tag significantly exceeds that of its predecessor, the H100, but the value proposition is clear. NVIDIA's transition into a software company is a strategic move that ensures recurring revenue for each chip sold, providing a substantial margin and solidifying CUDA as the preferred software platform for developers.

The impact extends beyond finances to areas like robotics and AI, promising to revolutionize industries such as manufacturing, transportation, surgical procedures, and humanoid robotics. This comprehensive suite of hardware and software products, coupled with licensing and SAAS offerings, underscores the breadth of NVIDIA's reach.

Industrial companies are rushing to explore the possibilities offered by NVIDIA, recognizing that joining forces with NVIDIA can drive down their Total Cost of Operations (TCO). This aspect, often overlooked, is the true differentiator for NVIDIA—a connective tissue that permeates every segment and underpins its unparalleled value proposition.

Understanding the concept of Total Cost of Operations (TCO) is crucial, especially for industrial players. NVIDIA's ability to swiftly identify efficiencies and resolve issues in warehouses or factories highlights its immense value. For CSPs like AMZN, MSFT, GOOGL, ORCL, the significance of TCO cannot be overstated. Regardless of the investment required for NVIDIA chips and the accompanying recurring revenue, it's still a more cost-effective solution compared to alternatives—because time is of the essence, and waiting for a thousand years simply isn't an option.

 In conclusion, NVIDIA's Blackwell chip marks a transformative moment in technology, redefining industry standards and solidifying NVIDIA's position as a leader in AI and computing. Its impact extends across various sectors, promising not just technological advancements but also significant financial gains for both NVIDIA and its partners. As Blackwell becomes increasingly integrated into critical systems and processes, its influence on innovation and efficiency is set to shape the future landscape of technology and business. 

 TL;DR:

* NVIDIA's Blackwell chip represents a monumental leap in technology, surpassing previous advancements by a significant margin.
* Cloud service providers (CSPs) are heavily reliant on Blackwell for training large language models, setting a new standard in the industry.
* Financially, Blackwell commands a premium but promises substantial recurring revenue and solidifies CUDA as a preferred software platform.
* Beyond finances, Blackwell's impact extends to robotics, AI, manufacturing, transportation, and more.
* Industrial companies recognize the potential to reduce Total Cost of Operations (TCO) by leveraging NVIDIA's technology.
* Understanding TCO is crucial, as NVIDIA's efficiency and effectiveness offer unparalleled value compared to alternatives, making it a game-changer in various industries.",wallstreetbets,https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bidsv8/bullish_takeaway_from_todays_gtc_nvda/,2024-03-19 02:34:04,0.13332965902410346,0.5407734754956978,0.017,0.195,0.9988

PE ratio is a SHITTY way to evaluate how good a company is (DD Analysis),"My intuition always told me that stocks with low PE (Price Earnings) ratio **SUCKED**. I remember when people tried to convince me Intel was a good buy because ""it's PE ratio was low!"" and that Tesla was a terrible stock ""because it's PE ratio is high!"". And yet, even though Tesla's PE ratio used to be 1400 in 2021, it's now at about 40. Makes you think huh? 🤔

[Tesla PE Ratio in January 2021](https://preview.redd.it/bjn0h5v228pc1.png?width=3118&format=png&auto=webp&s=a55d655f59c1571f326911047611f2dbe8a214c4)

Thus, I decided to test this explicitly. I wanted to see if PE ratio ACTUALLY mattered. I found that it matters A LOT... if you want to lose money 😂

# DD on PE

[I have a full writeup here](https://nexustrade.io/blog/you-will-never-look-at-a-stocks-pe-ratio-the-same-after-reading-this-20240319). First, I used an LLM to find 10 stocks with a PE ratio below 10 that had the highest market caps as of **January 1st 2023**. I got the following list:

* Company: Exxon Mobil Corporation (Symbol: XOM)
   * Description: Engages in the exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas globally.
   * P/E Ratio: 9.04616
   * Market Cap: $471,642,800,000
* Company: Pfizer Inc. (Symbol: PFE)
   * Description: Discovers, develops, and sells biopharmaceutical products worldwide.
   * P/E Ratio: 9.65214
   * Market Cap: $287,302,680,000
* Company: Toyota Motor Corporation (Symbol: TM)
   * Description: Designs, manufactures, and sells passenger vehicles and related parts globally.
   * P/E Ratio: 7.47751
   * Market Cap: $189,102,358,004
* Company: Verizon Communications Inc. (Symbol: VZ)
   * Description: Provides communications, technology, and entertainment products and services worldwide.
   * P/E Ratio: 8.5848
   * Market Cap: $165,519,400,000
* Company: ConocoPhillips (Symbol: COP)
   * Description: Explores for, produces, and markets crude oil, natural gas, and LNG globally.
   * P/E Ratio: 8.56037
   * Market Cap: $152,195,338,000
* Company: AT&T Inc. (Symbol: T)
   * Description: Provides telecommunications and technology services worldwide.
   * P/E Ratio: 6.76593
   * Market Cap: $140,781,270,000
* Company: QUALCOMM Incorporated (Symbol: QCOM)
   * Description: Develops  foundational technologies for the wireless industry globally.
   * P/E Ratio: 9.54411
   * Market Cap: $123,352,680,000
* Company: The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (Symbol: GS)
   * Description: Provides financial services for corporations, institutions, and individuals worldwide.
   * P/E Ratio: 9.02693
   * Market Cap: $121,899,900,000
* Company: Intel Corporation (Symbol: INTC)
   * Description: Designs, develops, and sells computing products and services globally.
   * P/E Ratio: 8.12612
   * Market Cap: $108,838,740,000
* Company: Citigroup Inc. (Symbol: C)
   * Description: Provides financial products and services globally.
   * P/E Ratio: 5.71683
   * Market Cap: $87,814,045,000

I then ran a backtest on these stocks from **Jan 1st, 2023 to March 19th, 2024**. I did ""Buy and Hold"" for each stock on this list. I then got the following results.

[Backtesting \\""Buy and Hold\\"" across these 10 stocks](https://preview.redd.it/qenikmgz28pc1.png?width=2054&format=png&auto=webp&s=c05cd8ee1b41370712194f63b262e56b0742bae7)

Most of the stocks in the portfolio like Toyota, Verizon, and AT&T were flat. Intel was a ""big"" winner and Pfizer was a huge loser. In the end, **this combination of stocks didn't even outperform SPY.**

https://preview.redd.it/78ql0h4b38pc1.png?width=754&format=png&auto=webp&s=9435697de6abfc6618cf5194b4c1757128081315

This is in contrast to something like Cash Flow, which has been shown to *slightly* outperform the S&P 500.

[Seeing how well 5 companies with the highest free cash flow increase from 2016 to 2020 performed. This stategy outperformed the market.](https://preview.redd.it/e6fokktp48pc1.png?width=2054&format=png&auto=webp&s=1232f6c7ec93a70aec2efbdbc18b9da620f2af23)

# What did we learn?

Know that next time, ANYTIME someone says ""the PE ratio is low"", they are officially a regard and a parrot that regurgitates NPC talking points. PE ratio means jack-diggedly squat, and literally can't outperform SPY. At the same time, other metrics (like the increase in free cash flow) actually matters when picking good stocks.

AI missing link,"Let’s discuss potential missing link for the AI boom before it spirals into oblivious amount of worldwide adoption and hopefully find a missing link before it kicks off big time because that’s direction where  technology is headed.

First of all we need to discuss what could AI potentially mean for our future and what implications it might have.

To my best of knowledge from reading various statements and articles, AI is going to take a big chunk of jobs across all of the sectors.

Logistics

Teslas Cybertruck will have an option of following one another and therefore you’ll have a fleet of trucks, commandeered by one driver who’s first in the convoy, cruising on a highway
Tesla is already mapping all the roads to perfection before the commercial usage of cybertrucks to it’s fullest.

Automation of factory jobs

There’s activist already actively protesting like we’re back in 1760 during the start of the industrial revolution.


Healthcare 

An AI doctor is currently learning about (Chatgpt-like software) that’s potentially going to make better judgments and diagnosis then the doctors themselves
We still might be a long way down the road from this one, but money is clearly being dumped into projects like these 

Education 

AI softwares will have an ability to recognize students learnings patterns and adapt the learning program to each student individually.
Results have been proven already at staggering 62% grade improvement. 
Not everyone learns the same and that’s the problem AI will fix

These are very few of many sectors in which AI will intertwine with our lives and it’s only the beginning. 

As with all booms in the tech, AI is the logical next step.

For AI to achieve massive adoption it needs computing power, advertisement and ___________?

To break them down

Computing power

If you haven’t heard about Nvidia, Dell, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing etc.  you must live under a rock
These companies have been under the spotlight for a while now and they’re making record deals and gains.
For example.in 2013 Nvidia sold 1.5mil units of their H100 GPUs to Meta, Microsoft, Google and other companies for 37.5Billion in revenue only from 1 processor(wait times were about 6 months).
They’re also expecting to ship 2 million of the same GPU in this year.
With currently a supply being shorter then the demand, many companies are on a race to pick up the biggest pie of the cake and that was reflected on their stock prices.
With that being said ,Computing Power was one fragment of AI boom where the money could have been made by us investors( that’s if you recognized the opportunity on time) .
Not saying there’s no more money to be made in this sector but we’ve definitely come far, fast. 

The next fragment needed for a massive adoption of AI is advertisement.

Google and Amazon are taking the first spots 
AI is directly used in advertising products across all of the sectors.
It’s abilities are reducing the amount of manpower for the job and it’s is also self advertising by doing so.
These kind of automated tasks will give companies the ability to reduce labour cost which will directly translate into higher revenue.
Massive adoption of AI in advertisement sector is coming sooner then you think. 

For a seed to become a tree it will need water, sunlight,and carbon dioxide.
As we mentioned above, massive AI adoption will need Computing Power, Advertisement and something else to really take over the whole technological sector like a wildfire.
The reason why I believe it needs something else to spark is because it’s simply not there yet.

There’s been great opportunities to make money in the last year with crypto going parabolic, especially AI projects, plain company stocks that sell/manufacture semi conductors, playing call options on their earnings, holding or playing call options on microstrategy etc.

It's time to go big short QQQ/SPY,"Good evening fellow regards,

I never thought I'd be saying this but, this bull market is actually about to get some dick and we can make money buying puts. I'm usually not citing reasons aside from charts because fundamentals and environmental speculation are typically irrelevant, but since the market is making a major top there are indeed catalysts and warning signals. 

Let me start with the most compelling reason: BOJ is set to raise interest rates. There had been speculation on this in August the last time the market pulled back. Google this to learn about why it matters cuz it's too much to explain. The tl;Dr is the yen/usd trade enables a ponzi scheme in US equities that's mainly possible because of the negative Japanese rate. 

How about warning signals in the charts? ⚠️ 

Today the current market leaders (chip stocks) rejected a bullish break upwards in their chart and went into ""system.sell mode"". I call it ""system.sell"" because the character of the selling is very much controlled and gradual. You could see it in 2022 often. 

Other former bad boys on the street, MSFT and AAPL, also rejected breakouts recently. 

Major tops usually press into and fail against resistance multiple times with broadening candles. See QQQ and SPY charts. 🕵️‍♂️ 

Bonus reasons and speculative targets for downside: 

1) McDonald's said recently people aren't buying their trash ass food because everyone is broke as fuck and out of savings. Might also throw some money at puts on these devils since these guys are the ones picket fencing the end of the world and their chart had spooky 👻 drops recently. 


2) Biden has recently asked Congress to dole out stimmy to the housing industry. Stimmy is usually reserved for the abatement of recession. 


3) It's March 18. Usually markets get some dick in February and March. The volume drawing catalysts of GTC and FOMC gives big money a decent way to exit some risk after a massive run up from last year's bottom. 

My first target QQQ is 420, then 402.5, and 385 for a potential bottom(could be lower or higher, but im just looking at technical probability). Chart watchers would say it's 392, but volatility usually causes markets to overshoot. 

I don't really know about SPY cuz I don't trade it. But, your wife's boyfriend could probably tell you. 

Good luck, my friends. Also, for a stop loss and abandonment of this idea I'd reckon a break and close above 445 QQQ is where that's at.

"Elon Musk teases flying car in Don Lemon interview: ""Jetsons Vibes""","*In an interview with journalist Don Lemon released in full on Monday morning, the Tesla and SpaceX CEO was asked about the new model of the Roadster—the car manufacturer's original design—which is due to be released next year. ""Look, I don't want to give away much more than what I've said publicly, except that the Roadster will be a collaboration between SpaceX and Tesla—so you can expect some rocket-y stuff there,"" he said.*  

*Asked by Lemon if it could be a flying car, Musk responded: ""Maybe,"" before waggling his head and laughing. ""It's not out of the question. I've got to reserve the cool stuff for when we actually unveil it, but it's going to be really cool; it's going to have some rocket technology in it.""*

*He added: ""I think, really, the only way to do something that's cooler than the Cybertruck is to combine SpaceX and Tesla technology to create something that's not ever really a car.""*

*""Then what would it be?"" Lemon asked.*

*""Something that's never existed before,"" Musk said, before agreeing with Lemon that it would have ""Jetsons vibes,"" a reference to the space age Hanna-Barbera cartoon which features flying cars.*

***WHAT WE KNOW:***

*Musk has previously teased the collaboration between his two companies in a June 2018 post on X, formerly Twitter—a platform which he now also owns.*

*At the time, he said the electric sports car would have a SpaceX-designed optional package that would include around **""10 small rocket thrusters arranged seamlessly around \[the\] car""** that would ""dramatically improve acceleration, top speed, braking & cornering. Maybe they will even allow a Tesla to fly...""*

*In 2019, he wrote that the new model would be able to go from zero to 60 miles per hour in 2.1 seconds ""before adding \[the\] rocket thruster option.""*

*Then late last month, Musk wrote on X that he had ""radically increased the design goals for the new Tesla Roadster,"" adding: ""There will never be another car like this, if you could even call it a car.""*

A little about RKLB and why I'm sharing this with you..

RocketLabUSA is a new big player in the space industry, they're gonna be like spaceX v2.0, except publicly traded, and owns hundreds of contracts with the government. They recently partnered with NASA to go on space missions and they're well funded. They even  have contracts for IoT Machines & Technology, IoT is the technology where you can control physical things by just simply the Internet, which you already know how huge that is, especially do they implement that into their space missions. I attached screenshots of their upcoming missions, I didn't get All of them since they got a lot planned for 2024, basically All the work they did in the past was literally built for 2024, so this is a huge beginning for them. All the missions that I mentioned and you'll read about are all scheduled to launch in 2024! Including NASA missions.

I saw this and I've been learning more about them for a month now, I'm extremely excited to see their growth.

Key Financial Results:

Revenue: Micron reported revenue of $4.8 billion for the quarter, a decrease of 12% from $5.45 billion in the same quarter last year, falling short of the consensus analysts’ forecast of $5.1 billion. The decline reflects continued softening in global demand for DRAM and NAND products, exacerbated by intensifying competition and price erosion.

Earnings Per Share (EPS): The company posted EPS of $0.65, underperforming against analysts’ expectations of $0.75. This marks a 20% decline from the EPS of $0.81 reported in the corresponding quarter of the previous year. The lower profitability is primarily attributed to increased production costs and inventory write-downs, impacting gross margins.

Forward Guidance: Micron provided weaker than expected guidance for the upcoming quarter, projecting revenue in the range of $4.5 billion to $4.7 billion and EPS of $0.55 to $0.65, citing persistent market challenges and slower recovery in demand.

Statistical Analysis:

The earnings miss was underscored by a significant year-over-year (YoY) revenue decrease of 12%, illustrating the impact of adverse market dynamics on Micron’s core business segments. Additionally, the 19.75% shortfall in EPS against expectations reflects operational challenges, including higher than anticipated COGS (Cost of Goods Sold) and operational inefficiencies.

The company’s forward-looking statements suggest continued caution, with projected Q3 revenue indicating a potential sequential decline of approximately 2% to 6%, highlighting ongoing demand volatility and competitive pressures in the semiconductor space.

Management Commentary:

“We are navigating through a challenging period, marked by heightened competition and macroeconomic headwinds affecting global semiconductor demand,” said Sanjay Mehrotra, President and CEO of Micron Technology. “We remain focused on operational efficiency and are accelerating our investments in next-generation memory technologies to strengthen our market position. Despite short-term challenges, we are optimistic about the long-term demand drivers for our industry.”",wallstreetbets,https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bi3lsf/bear_case_for_mu_on_upcoming_earnings_using/,2024-03-18 18:11:15,0.03333333333333334,0.3837499999999999,0.069,0.084,0.4767

Why i short Hubspot (HUBS)," Why i short Hubspot (HUBS)

  
HUBS is like shopify a giant in online retail company that just started to boom with covid-19. Also like shopify it is a buissness to buissness and it helps small or even bigger companies to grow with its services. I personally think it's a good buissness in itself but the price is far higher than the moon, for more than 10 years the company has been unprofitable despite its growth and trades at a P/FCF of 120 in my eyes the challenge of being profitable is not factored into the price. Even if the company had an average revenue growth of 33% in the last years which is impressive, such an expensive price which is far above the ratings of the biggest 5 companies is not justified. To give you a perspective with a net profit margin of 10%, the company would have a P/E ratio of 140. let's say the company's revenue grows by 33% over the next 5 years, with a net profit margin of 10%, and the price will be the same in 5 years then the company would have a P/E rating of 107 in one year, one of 58 in 3 years and one of 33 in 5 years, this example shows how long the company would need in a bull case that the P/E rating goes from extremely extremely expensive to normally expensive. This example shows me that the current rating of the company is in any case very overvalued and that extreme price fluctuations downwards could happen.

  
For me personally, to rate the company, I imagined the bull case of 33% rev growth, net profit margin of 10% and a P/E rating of 30 in one year and I came to 164 dollars. However, the drop from 600 dollars to 170 dollars is rather unrealistic, which is why I have set my price target at 450 dollars so that the inefficiency of the market is still taken into account, but the complete highs have nevertheless fallen at 450.

$LAAC - New Lithium Mines + Overestimated Risk + Upcoming Earnings + New CEO = Profit,"**Earnings Report 3/21/24 —** ***est*** **$0.04 per share**

# $LAAC - Lithium Americas (Argentina) Corp.

* **Spot Price:** $4.72
* **Estimated Fair Value:** $25 *(Morning Star)*
* **Market Cap:** $759.97M
* **Volume:** 2.00M

**Context:**

Lithium Americas is a company that mines Lithium that recently split away from it's Argentina branch, forming LAAC. Recently, they opened a [new lithium mine](https://lithium-argentina.com/our-projects/cauchari-olaroz/default.aspx) in Argentina. Lithium has decent demand for obvious reasons, however this alone is not enough to pull the price of this stock up.  


**Flawed Market Analysis**

Looking at the Morning Star analysis, they place their fair value at **$25** a share with **Very High** uncertainty. I think this is a decent analysis, but I disagree with their risk assessment.   


The reason for risk goes along the lines of:

a)

>With operations in Argentina, Lithium Argentina is exposed to additional political risk. Threats of higher royalties would weigh on the firm's profit.

b)

>Lithium Argentina faces elevated project execution risk from developing a new greenfield project that could lead to delays and cost overruns, proving value destructive.

&#x200B;

(a) is a dumb reason because unless you've been living under a rock, Argentina has elected a leader who hates taxes. This is kinda like, low IQ DD but 🤷.  


(b) is dumb because the project is already operational. It seems like these risk assessments are older.   


**Insider Buying:**

This is a new company so obviously executives are going to be buying stocks, however this is a good sign that the internals of the company are looking positive. Especially as directors of the projects continue to buy stocks leading up to the earnings report.

&#x200B;

**Strategy:**

This stock is fairly cheap and the company is fairly undervalued, so it would be good enough  to buy naked shares on its own. However if you NEED to buy options, `LAAC $7.5c @ 12/20/24` appear to be the best value to risk ratio.

We need larger models. Video and 3d. We need these models grounded in physics.

We NEED BIGGER GPU'S

I want to introduce you to a very BIG GPU

Blackwell - David Blackwell (mathematician, game theorist, probability)

2 largest dies possible.

128 billion transistors

20 peta flops

384 g HBE ram

40 petaflops of AI performance

80 petaflops

80 GB/s bandwidth

36 Grace CPU's

14.4 Tb/s bandwith

NVLINK

GB200 NVL72

Quantum InfiniBand

Liquid Cooling

Jesus this thing is SKYNET itself

GH100 most advanced today - Blackwell is 2x the size physically and will be the most advanced. 208 billion transistors.

Grace Blackwell system - But there is more.

**UPDATE:**

2.5 x FPA for training over G Hopper

FP6 -

FP4 40 flops 5x - important for inference.

Inference is generation - old computing is retrieval of data - this is generating tokens.

Vast majority of content will not be retrieved but rather generated. This is FP4 - and Blackwell is 5x the inference capability.

Seems like enough but why stop there. It's NOT enough.

We NEED A BIGGER GPU.

J Huang is cooking

Blackwell is a BEAST

We still NEED MORE Need another chip

NVLINK Switch Chip

50B Transistors - It doesn't even make sense. Build a system to talk to every GPU and CHIP at the same time - connect over a coherent link - 1 Giant GPU.

DGX GB200 NVL72

1 Giant GPU

Training FP8 720 PFLOPS 22x WTF

Inference FP4 = 45x WTF LOL

Worlds first 1 xoflop machine in 1 rack. Only 2 or 3 on the planet.

The world entire internet in these wires. and it's liquid cooled.

GPU's are 3000 lbs. that's 1.5 TONS. WTF lol My goodness.

The inference capability of Blackwell is 30x greater!

FP4 Tensor core and NVLINK Switch - is the true key to the innovation here. it is communicating 10x faster than the past.

Blackwell is the shit. There is so much Blackwell is going to bring. It's going to bring the AI industrial revolution. Sovereign AI - Telco's everyone is signing up for blackwell.

Jensen Huang is cooking!

**Update:**

Digital Twins with Nvidia's Omniverse DGX Cloud is a really big deal. You can create and build a digital twin world so that you can scale and build faster. Also, it has profound robotics implications.

AGX - SOC - Designed for Robotics

JETSON - This is legit. I work on this.

The virtual world is Omniverse - It is hosted in the Azure Cloud

AI and Omniverse OVX (digital twin) They are giving a platform for

A robotics building / warehouse and there will be some autonomous systems.

This is wild, the NIMS and DGX Cloud you can virtualize a world that you can train your robots and hardware on. it's how you'll test the hardware running their autonomous robotic stack.

You will have to have the digital twins.

Siemens is building the Industrial metaverse.

Nvidia Omniverse Cloud

**Update:**

Autonomous vehicles as a service. THOR for BYD first usage.

Apple getting direct link to tie Apple Vision Pro to Omniverse. So apple to microsoft Azure. lol.

**Update:**

Ended with Robotics, Nims, Jetson, Omniverse Digital AI workloads / Digital Twins. This may become the largest company in the world. This will all be going to robotics. This will be the next industrial revolution.

NGL. Was feeling nervous the other day. Doubting myself. Now I'm feeling okay.  You see this small build up on decent volume. Price is up premarket. This being a Fed week complicates things. If the overall market reaction is bad to a hawkish fed, prices could go down as collateral damage.  If that happens. Sit tight and buy more if possible. People will be looking for value stocks eventually in combination with greed, news, and excitement, build up could be slow.

Slow build up is ideal. We don't want huge fast price spikes which will make the stock volatile and unstable...resulting in nervous twitchy investors. All is well. Weed will be legal. Oh yeah. Fuck boomers and fuck Nixon. If I knew where his grave is, I'd piss on it.

$CDNS - Pick & Shovel,"**Skippable Background:** While at a relatively new friend's birthday party this weekend, a gentleman who I believe was my friend's father struck up a conversation with me. One thing led to another, and he started telling me about his finance guy on Wall Street, about how he knew what CPI was going to be before it was released, that recent increases were driven by car insurance, and more importantly how he couldn't miss when it came to recommending stocks. He had recommended NVDA last year and was now bullish on Cadence Design Systems. 

I spent the rest of the weekend digging into Cadence ($CDNS) and decided maybe this guy's guy couldn't miss, at at least not on this. 

**Business Overview:** Cadence is a software company that can be likened to the pick and shovel sellers for the California gold rush in the mid 1800s.  Cadence's products and services enable their customers to design semiconductor and electronic systems that are used in data centers and for generative AI, among others.  Demand for Cadence's technology and expertise is driven by increasing complexity of these systems. Clear thesis here. 

Their revenue ($4bn in 2023) is primarily driven through licensing agreements, and 84% of their revenue is recurring in nature, as you'd expect with a software company. They have $6bn of backlog, and expect to realize 54% ($3.36bn) of that this year, which is a positive given substantial proportion of Cadence's software licenses yield revenue over time, making it difficult rapidly raise revenue in any one fiscal period. 

[$CDNS revenue \('21-'23\)](https://preview.redd.it/w1twzaf9s4pc1.jpg?width=1890&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c1d80ee673329264b4d26074288bf7f06ed5d22f)

**Risks / Competitors:** Lots of R&D expenditure required to keep pole position, but the Company is doing this both organically and inorganically, so I'm not too worried here. From a competition standpoint, Cadence competes with Synopysy (which just acquired Anysys) and Siemens EDA. I don't love the consolidation amongst competitors, but Cadence is also an active acquirer (including the $1.2bn acquisition of BETA CAE earlier this month). 

Anyways here's my position - mix of shares and options. Given I only spent the weekend digging in, this isn't even half baked yet. But I like what I've seen so far.

$CLSK price action last month. Could we see a potential $90-$120 price target ?,"I’ve been following crypto mining stocks for the past 3 months. Especially with the halving happening and BTC hitting all time highs, I’ve noticed the miners are also playing catch up with BTC and have entered a new bull cycle. 
For the past couple weeks we had a good consolidation and looking at the price of bitcoin and the price action of miners, my expectations are that in the next few weeks we should see a breakout into a new cycle run. 🚀
All the charts 📈 show that next couple week $CLSK should be hitting $35. 
But for this crypto bull cycle I’m looking at $90 from a bearish 🐻 perspective. 

What are your thoughts?

Breakout for Venm…err PYPL!?,"After two and a half years our old friends at PayPal seem to not only have bottomed, but broken a prolonged downward trends and consolidation below the 50 week moving average.  While I think the company should change its name to Venmo (still possible), the worst is behind for this company.  They have over $5b in free cash flow and this time around I don’t think they’ll make the mistake of trying to buy an app/website that my wife used to use when she was in college.

This company relative to its peers is cheap at a forward P/E below that of the lower than the S&P.

I got burned by this PYPL in 21 and I’m back for some more.  

PYPL reports May 1 and this once beloved company is either burning to the ground or taking flight.  I’m going with the latter.

Apple Paying Almost $500M Over the Tim Cook's China Comments,"So, if you checked news back in 2018, that comments was before the first Apple's revenue cut and loss more than $70B with the stock fall.

During the call in the same 2018, our famous CEO said that though Apple had sales problems in a few countries with high inflation rate (like Brazil and Russia), there were no such problems for China. But then, just a few days later, Apple decided to cut production and requested it from the suppliers, so I think it was obviously otherwise.

And just in two months Apple shocked everyone with its first announcement about the revenue cut since the iPhone establishment in 2007, causing AAPL to drop by 10% and resulting in 70B losses.

This was the reason of several big scandals and lawsuits based on the Cook's comments, but Apple denied that they had any wrongdoing in this case (and they continue to deny it to this day).

So, at this point, this whole story is going to an end because yesterday, news reported that Apple decided to pay $490M to investors due to the situation (even before the court hearing), so if you were one of those damaged investors, you [can check it out](https://11thestate.com/cases/apple-investor-settlement).

(MSFT) How to profit from my r/singularity delusions this week?,"Hi revvered WSB.

I'm visiting here from deep in the trenches of r/singularity, a community almost equally deranged as yours. We have strong reasons to believe that a new release of GPT will happen tomorrow (march 19th) and that Microsoft will be integrating this into their copilot offering (march 21:st).

>Ok now we have multiple things pointing to a March 19 release:

>1. Same conditions as March 14th GPT-4 Tuesday release last year: Microsoft event on Thursday, upcoming Lex Fridman interview with Sam

>2. Microsoft Copilot offering GPT-4 Turbo for free, so there’s very little incentive for ChatGPT Plus.

>3. Discontinuation of plugins on ChatGPT on March 19

>The Microsoft event is titled “Advancing the new era of work with Copilot”. What would they be advancing if they just showed us the same old Copilot we’ve had this entire time? Of course, I could be wrong

Given the developments in the space, and cryptic tweets from OpenAI employees this release *will in the community beliefs* surpass market expectations. There are several other good reasons for this from a game theory perspective as well. This should be especially huge for MSFT as it seems like OpenAI have pivoted heavily towards agentic development, providing beautiful synergy effects for MSFT utilization of gpt in copilot with their office suite offering. They are singlehandedly sitting in this unique position in the AI hype market rn.

I believe this 100%, I believe we will see positive returns on MSFT this week.

**My question to you degens:** Given that I believe this, how can I best profit from this prediction with limited capital? Are bull certificates with multipliers the way to go or is another financial instrument better used?

Thank you dear wizards of stock markets.",wallstreetbets,https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bho3e2/msft_how_to_profit_from_my_rsingularity_delusions/,2024-03-18 07:07:30,0.1525242504409171,0.4499037999037999,0.015,0.141,0.9903
TSM Q1 '24 rev - What am I missing? Aren't we going to miss this by $750m USD?,"Hi fellow regards,

&#x200B;

Beyond feeling bullish AF due to AI hype (did an awful trade in Nvidia even though I was long lollll so now I'm in some TSM May 170c), I decided based on a post in the last week to do the TINIEST bit of research on TSM...

&#x200B;

So what's the smallest research I could do? 

&#x200B;

I can look at the revenue numbers TSM themselves post on a monthly basis. I noticed something doesn't add up and that it feels like a few dollars be missing...I want someone to tell me my maths is shit and point out the gap in my analysis (if you can call it that)...

&#x200B;

In 2024 so far we've got:

* Jan '24: 215,785 TWD = 6,815 USD (7.9% YoY increase)
* Feb '24: 181,648 TWD = 5,737 USD (11.3% YoY increase)
* Mar '24: ?? TWD
* Total so far:  397,433 TWD =  12,553 USD ($12.5 B USD) 

&#x200B;

We've got estimates of (taken from yahoo finance - I know gggg) Mar 2024 Quarter Avg. estimated revenue = $18.52B USD

&#x200B;

Looking at the 2023 numbers of Mar '23: 145,408 TWD = 4,592 USD, even giving this a 15% increase YoY (which is greater than the 2 previous months so far), we'd land at 167,219 TWD = 5,281 USD

&#x200B;

So all together:

* Jan + Feb + Projected Mar = 6.8 B + 5.7 B + 5.2 B = 17.7B

&#x200B;

Based on my extremely basic maths, it looks like I'm missing $750M USD...can someone please tell me I'm a super regard?",wallstreetbets,https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bhnulv/tsm_q1_24_rev_what_am_i_missing_arent_we_going_to/,2024-03-18 06:53:11,-0.05388888888888889,0.5333333333333333,0.047,0.083,0.8205

March 18 (Reuters) - Apple [(AAPL.O), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/AAPL.O) is in talks to build Google's Gemini artificial intelligence (AI) engine into the iPhone, Bloomberg News reported on Monday, citing people familiar with the situation.Apple also recently held discussions with the Microsoft [(MSFT.O), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/MSFT.O)\-backed OpenAI and has considered using its model, the report added.Apple and Google are in active negotiations to let the iPhone maker license Gemini to power some new features coming to the phone's software this year, 

Bloomberg said.Apple is preparing new capabilities as part of its upcoming iPhone iOS 18 based on its own homegrown AI models, but it is seeking a partner to power generative AI features, including functions for creating images and writing essays based on simple prompts, the report said.The two parties have not decided the terms or branding of an AI agreement or finalised how it would be implemented, 

Bloomberg said, adding it was unlikely that any deal would be announced until June, when Apple plans to hold its annual Worldwide Developers Conference.Both companies have an existing deal for Google to be the default search engine on Apple's Safari web browser.Apple, Google and OpenAI did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment outside business hours.

Apple has been slower in rolling out generative AI, which can generate human-like responses to written prompts, than rivals Microsoft and Google, which are weaving them into products.Last month, Apple CEO Tim Cook [said](https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-shareholders-reject-ai-disclosure-proposal-2024-02-28/) the company plans to disclose later this year more about its plans to put generative AI to use, adding that the company is investing ""significantly"" in the area.",wallstreetbets,https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bhkbcv/apple_in_talks_to_let_googles_gemini_power_iphone/,2024-03-18 02:39:43,0.04385026737967914,0.5215877259994907,0.0,0.053,0.9432

Taking his place is [Gil West](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gil-west-742439204?trk=public_profile_samename-profile), former chief operating officer of [Delta Airlines](https://www.delta.com/) and [General Motors’](https://www.gm.com/) Cruise unit.

“Gil’s success in leading over 70,000 people at Delta and orchestrating highly effective operational turnarounds will position him well to lead Hertz,” Colin Farmer, lead director of the Hertz board, said in a news release.

“He will be able to build upon the strategic projects begun during Stephen’s tenure, including improvements to technology, commercial partnerships and the revitalization of our value brands.”

The news comes weeks after reports that Hertz was [weighing job cuts](https://www.pymnts.com/earnings/2024/hertz-weighs-layoffs-amid-pivot-away-from-evs/) after selling off about a third of its electric vehicle (EV) fleet, saying it was losing money on the cars. In an interview with Bloomberg News at the time, Scherr said the company was aiming to save $250 million in other costs, which may include layoffs.

“The company clearly took on more EV exposure than where the market otherwise took us,” Scherr said. “The decision we made in the fourth quarter to make a pivot on EV sets us up for a transitional year that’s achievable. We’ll spring into 2025 a better company.”

In addition to selling its EV fleet, the company also halted plans to purchase tens of thousands of EVs from Sweden’s [Polestar](https://www.polestar.com/us/). As PYMNTS wrote last month, this is part of a larger pattern.

“While electric vehicles have been celebrated for their potential to [revolutionize transportation](https://www.pymnts.com/transportation/2024/volvos-funding-cut-highlights-ongoing-challenges-in-global-ev-market/) and accelerate the path toward a greener future, recent moves by original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to scale down production, divest and cut funding have cast a shadow over this once-optimistic narrative,” that report said.

And this week saw reports that EV sales were slowing due to consumer reluctance, fueled by a lack of a reliable and convenient charging infrastructure.

PYMNTS’ CEO Karen Webster noted late last year that EVs were “having their own early adopter moment.”

While early adopters were in a hurry to become the [first to own an EV](https://www.pymnts.com/consumer-insights/2023/what-electric-vehicles-impossible-foods-and-buy-now-pay-later-teach-us-about-early-adopters/) — and probably had another car to drive while the EV was recharging — mainstream consumers are more worried about EVs’ shorter driving ranges and underdeveloped charging infrastructure, she wrote.

"Apple Quietly Reveals MM1, a Multimodal AI LLM","A new [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.09611.pdf) from Apple presents MM1, a family of multimodal AI models that combine vision and language understanding. The researchers conducted extensive experiments to identify the key factors driving performance in these models, testing different architectural choices and pre-training data mixtures. 

 Key points:

* MM1 includes both dense models up to 30B parameters and mixture-of-experts (MoE) variants
* Image resolution has the biggest impact on performance, more than model size
* Specific vision-language connector design has little effect
* Mixing interleaved image+text, caption, and text-only data in pre-training is crucial
* 5:5:1 ratio of caption, interleaved, and text data works best
* Synthetic caption data helps for few-shot learning
* The 30B dense model beats prior SOTA on VQA and captioning tasks

Investments for another potential crypto bull run,"
Background:
 
It’s hard to say what will happen to bitcoin and the rest of crypto in the next 6-12 months. At this point, I think bitcoin already has such an established market cap. It’s also gained the respect of many institutional investors. This is why I think we’ll see a top of 125-175k bitcoin this cycle. At this price we’d have around a 4 trillion market cap making bitcoin the 2nd largest asset in the world only behind gold. 

Due to the world wide respect and size bitcoin has gained, I don’t think the bear market will be nearly as bad as we’ve seen. I think we’ll see a low of 80-100k bitcoin depending on how high it runs. I think this is because the market is going to start pricing in the effects of bitcoin halving.

I’ve heard plenty of times that bitcoin has no use case. However I think bitcoin’s main use case is an alternative to gold. Gold became an inflationary hedge due to its rarity and convenience. Bitcoin shares these qualities. For bitcoin to ever be valued 500k it would have a similar market cap as gold. So if you’re are super bullish on bitcoin you have to be very bearish on gold believing that bitcoin will overtake gold as the most valuable inflationary hedge. One day I think the combined crypto market will be worth more than gold. Not this cycle but in 10-20 years.
 
So, I definitely see bitcoin rising from its current price over the next year. What is the best way to invest in this? 


1: Directly buying bitcoin.

I think this a good idea right now. If you are able to HOLD. If we see bitcoin drop below 50k again before halving you can’t panic sell like so many people did last cycle. If you are investing your rent/food money that is a terrible idea. It needs to be money you can leave in bitcoin for at least a year. I honestly wouldn’t be surprised if we had a buyer who bought the top at 60-70k last cycle then sold the low around 20-30k then bought back now. True buy high sell low fashion. 

As I mentioned before, I think bitcoin will be less volatile after this cycle. So selling points really depend on your DCA crypto percentage and bag size. I picked up most of my crypto bag when bitcoin was 30k. So I will be selling atleast half my crypto at bitcoin 100-125k. For the other half I will probably hold onto for life. 

If you’re buying now, for the average investor I’d recommend simply holding for life. It’s harder than it sounds to time the top of bull cycles. If you’re dropping a lot of money and crypto takes up a big majority of your investments, I’d slowly sell at crucial points like 100,125,150k but permanently hold a big bag of crypto still.

I think buying the bitcoin ETF is the best idea to buy bitcoin. Coinbase isn’t a bad option. Personally I stay away from cold storage with larger market cap coins. 

2: Crypto stocks 

I really need to mention Microstrategy(MSTR) here. I don’t have the balls to fuck around here. You’re basically paying a premium on bitcoin for the guidance of Saylor and factors like shorting and options. 20% of MSTR is short. If bitcoin goes on a wild run these short sellers have buy out eventually rocketing MSTR. I have no idea what is going to happen to MSTR but it should be interesting to say the least.

Option premium is outrageous. If you’re very bullish on MSTR you can buy a call and sell a put credit spread to reduce your entry. Insanely risky but could pay off very well.

Next mining stocks. 

After the halving bitcoin miners will be earning half the amount of bitcoin. So it’s hard to say what will happened here. Last cycle, mining stocks went on a massive run and crashed back down.  Interestingly though, MARA was down 20% the week bitcoin reached ATH. So I don’t think buying shares is a better strategy than straight up buying bitcoin. You’re simply introducing outside factors. The only advantage here would be the ability to buy options. Mining stock option premiums aren’t too high. I think that buying 6-9 month expiration calls could be a play. 

3: Ethereum 

70% of my crypto bag is Ethereum. ETH is so far ahead of every other crypto in terms of the technology. ETH developers work diligently to improve the network too. For example, the transition from POW to POS drastically improved transaction and energy usage. And the recent Dencun upgrade made transaction fees nearly non existent for layer 2s. The security and scalability of ETH is the reason most developers find it to be a no-brainer to build on their network. Take a look at this post to learn more about ETH and even some use cases. https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/s/UdKatFpLZN

To purchase ETH I’d recommend Coinbase. If you’re buying an ETH quantity over 32 you can stake your ETH and earn 4% ish on it. If you’re buying this amount I’d recommend getting a ledger and staking your ETH. You could also stake through a third party like LDO with lower amounts of ETH.  I wouldn’t do this though because I don’t think that 4% appreciation is worth the risk of a third party.

There aren’t many ETH stocks that I know of. I know Ether Capital Corp and bit digital both stake ETH. I don’t see a benefit of buying those over ETH though.

It will be interesting to see the relationship between ETH and bitcoin over the next 10 years. Bitcoin is set up as an inflation hedge meanwhile ETH is the Tech king. Eth can surpass bitcoin’s market cap one day, it just depends on whether investors want the tech or the inflationary hedge.

4: Other layer 1s

I don’t see an “ETH killer” happening in the near future. However other layer 1s are still getting usage and have solid features. 

Solana is definitely a solid network. Transaction fees are near 0 and developers are flocking to this network.

Similar scenario with Avalanche.

5: meme coins

There’s serious money to be made in these crypto’s. If you can get in early on a solid project you can make a nice 10x. A lot of these are pump and dumps though and it’s hard to filter between. Solana meme coins are going wild and avalanche coins are following. I own coq inu, bonk, Brett and kimbo.

6: NFTs

Most NFTs will net you a loss. However, if you can find the right project you can cover your entry simply by holding. For example, BAYC holders got airdropped Mutant apes which peaked at 40 ETH.

"When T+1 goes live on May 28, how will that affect the market? And will institutional trades look different too?","So the settlement period for trading of securities is moving from T+2 to T+1 on May 28. 

This should make non-margin retail trading more responsive, right, and all securities more liquid? Like, if you buy with unsettled funds in a cash account, you can sell the next day instead of waiting two days to sell. So you can react faster in order to profit more or reduce loss.

So then:

1) The focus has been on rules for retail trades, but there are also changes going into effect for institutional investors. How exactly is institutional trading affected?

2) What are your predictions - will the new rules make the trading environment more volatile or less? Personally, I kinda see this change as adding volatility by increasing the volume of trades, but overall decreasing volatility, smoothing out jaggedness in price action caused by the T+2 delay.

Regarding the changes for institutional trading, the SEC says here, https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-29:

>In addition to shortening the standard settlement cycle, the final rules will improve the processing of institutional trades. Specifically, the final rules will require a broker-dealer to either enter into written agreements or establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure the completion of allocations, confirmations, and affirmations as soon as technologically practicable and no later than the end of trade date. The final rules also require registered investment advisers to make and keep records of the allocations, confirmations, and affirmations for certain securities transactions.

2. **Tech Boom**: With everything going digital, from 5G to IoT to self-driving cars, the demand for chips is through the roof. TSM's got the tech and the chops to meet that demand and then some.

3. **Top Dog Status**: TSM ain't just any semiconductor company; they're the top dog in the manufacturing game. They're pumping out chips using cutting-edge tech like 7nm and 5nm processes. That's like printing money, baby.

4. **Supply Chain Master**: While other companies might be struggling with supply chain issues, TSM's got it locked down tight. Their solid supply chain and diverse customer base mean they're not just surviving the chaos; they're thriving in it.

5. **Bullish Buzz**: You know how hype can send a stock to the moon? Well, TSM's been getting some serious buzz lately. Whether it's talks of new partnerships or killer earnings, the sentiment around TSM is sky-high, and that could mean big gains for us.

Happy Sunday everyone. I wanted to highlight a company that has a super strong catalyst. If there are any doubts or any questions, by all means please ask. I would love to hear the bear case of this thesis. 

ZIM integrated shipping was once a cash cow. During the pandemic they were averaging near 4,000 to 5,000 a container and raked in billions per a year… Even giving out a colossal 25+ in dividends in 2022. This is no typo but in 2022 the company earned nearly 8 billion in cash on 12.56 billion in sales! Please, by all means check! 

We are in a what have you done for me lately society. Post pandemic people want instant gratification, instant gains. So now is the time to jump in on ZIM… Why?

The last time ZIM paid a special dividend it was near this time last year, a 6.40 dividend. At that time they made 3.44 per share. \[Full year average container was 3,240\] but for the fourth quarter when they raked in cash the average was 2,122. The 4th quarter which was just reported the average rate was a dreadful 1,100! \[So you have an idea, pre pandemic, the rates were 1,600-1,900\] Fast forward to today, with the war… rates started to spike in December, I would have gladly bet that the average rate would have been much higher than the 1,139 for Q3, and when it ended up being 1,100 for the 4th quarter, that was pathetic. Stock deserved to be down…

However, the guidance was very odd, I have read the earnings call 2x, questions were asked why the wide range..

Well no one can predict war! I have checked spot rates since January 15th and I have attached photos of the 2 main sources used to check spot rates… The rates have hovered above 2,000 almost the entire quarter!

Analysts as of Friday having ZIM lose 83 cents a share for the first quarter that ends March 31st… I would love to bet anyone anywhere that they will slam that by at least 25+ cents. I would not be surprised if they come in at a profit! Why? The new vessels are much more fuel efficient, costs are going down, on the balance sheet the debt is rising as the new vessels come into play. These newer ships will better the bottom lines! I do not know of the 2rd, 3rd of full year, as analysts tried several ways to ask during the call, but I know the first quarter will be a blow up!

We have a big bonus! About 30 million shares are short of the 95 million float, or near 33%. Just because a company is short doesn’t mean it will squeeze.. however this catalyst of war, makes it very profitable….. It was asked on the call if they would be dividends if the company does indeed profit…. And it was answered that it was early to assume but that they have not changed the dividend policy 30% of profits!

$DXCM and Google,"Hey boys and ladies,

  
I bought into DexCom (200 shares at $136.80) after the company got their FDA approval for an over-the-counter continuous glucose monitor called Stelo. I thought this is a cool product that fitness geeks and diabetes people will all like. I would never use it, but it's cool if other people use it.

I noticed in some articles that Google is a big investor in DexCom. I checked Google's most recent 13F and the company is currently holding 3,681,885 shares at a value of $456,885,110. The shares held by Google have continuously increased over the past few months. Not a ton of money for Google, but I wonder what Google is doing with these holdings? I saw news that they partnered with them a while back for health apps and whatnot, but what other purpose is there? 

One conspiracy theory that I thought of is that the USA is basically a population of pre-diabetic fat asses. Regular people will use this over-the-counter product and connect it to their Google account, then Google will have access to lots of people's actual blood glucose levels in real-time, which it could analyze to understand when people would be pissed and upset and have less overall tolerance for things when they have low-blood-sugar and feel better when they have higher blood sugar.  For instance, my wife and I just got into an argument about how she hates where we live and hates our children's school and wants to move to a new place. Turns out she was just hungry. Google can use this data for premium targeted ads that are timed for when you have low blood sugar (snickers, your not you when your hungry) or even sell this data to pharma companies that will convince you in a timely way that you suffer from anxiety or depression and that you need to be on medicine for the rest of your life to be normal but really you just needed to eat a banana. 

The missing piece for me is what's in it for DexCom? Do they make any money on this?

My point here is that I'm thinking of putting more money into this company.  The recent dip makes me think bag holders got out on the gap up and now the stock is consolidating but the high PE makes me think I make a mistake.

NVDA's week ahead - a regarded opinion,"Disclaimer: I am not accredited, educated, well regarded. This is not financial advice, instead it is financial ~~non-~~fiction. Up to reader discretion if you wanna re-add the ""non"" part, but not like Qanon, instead like Nvidianon.

**GTC**

When viewing the long term charts of NVDA, massive explosion on upwards since last year, and lots of ""consolidation"" (whatever that means) the last couple of weeks. GTC has the opportunity to reinvoke investor faith, unveil new technologies and software, unveil new partnerships, and legitimize the AI industry as a whole. Although it technically started today, the major talking points aren't until Monday. The CEO key note isn't till after the hours. And there might be more hype announcements and information over the course of Tues - Thursday. That said, I expect GTC will cause Monday to be a steady green day, leading up to the CEO key note at the after hours. The key note might ramp up NVDA in the Monday after hours, and Tuesday pre market. Tuesday should open fairly hot, possibly some resistance and sell offs, but still a green day if there's more news and announcements related to GTC. This will be mitigated a bit by the FOMC.

**FOMC**

Starts Tuesday, ends Wednesday. Anticipation of it will slow down the bull run on NVDA, and otherwise negatively impact the market as a whole. JPow 2 weeks ago stated they were still looking to do interest rate cuts later this year, if the FOMC can restore faith of this, it might have a bullish impact that further ignites NVDA... otherwise if there's a bearish impact the NVDA hype train will be dampened and potentially more horizontal movements instead of new ATHs.

**Sentiment**

I've seen a lot of ""analysts"" on YouTube give their take on the forecast for NVDA. The bearish ones don't even utter the words ""GTC"", seemingly oblivious to it, solely stuck in their charts and numbers, unaware of major events outside of the FOMC. The fact bearish sentiment still exists in fairly high volume (still a lot of 3/22 puts on NVDA), means to me that the MM can/will siphon money from the bears, and allow a bullish trend.

**Price Guesstimates**

New ATH this week for NVDA. I don't think we're seeing $1100 this week. But I do feel that it's more likely to see $1100 than the $700s. $975 - $1025 is my guesstimate for how high NVDA reaches this week.",wallstreetbets,https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bh2k4x/nvdas_week_ahead_a_regarded_opinion/,2024-03-17 13:02:16,0.06503914141414141,0.483010101010101,0.034,0.056,0.8724

Paying interest on stock that you’re forced to take,"Been doing well this year selling deep in the money vertical spread puts. Profits are much better than buying OTM calls when a stonk moons. Said to myself Friday, Apple sure hasn’t done shit lately. I think it’s time. Loaded up on cheap ITM puts. Guess what happened? Somebody decided to exercise a shit fuck ton of puts that still had over 60 days to expiration. What I didn’t know was that my broker will only auto exercise the in the money long leg, if it’s at expiration. Woke up Saturday morning with 10,000 shares of Apple. Not necessarily a huge deal because I can just exercise the long leg myself and sell the shares back. My question from a fellow smooth brain is - Will I have to pay margin interest on the $2 million worth of Apple shares sitting in my account over the weekend?

Edit: Yes, you pay margin for the shares. Today there was a margin sell order. Called the broker and they cancelled it on the condition that I sell the stock covered to collect the remaining value on the long leg. Worst case I exercise the long for the original $.05 loss.

Edit 2: Td allowed the sale of the covered calls but they tried calling me and I missed the call so they closed the remaining contacts that I was offloading. At the end of the day, I think if apple opened up deeply red, it would have been better since the increase in IV would have made for better premiums.

Bearish Market on Wednesday this week,"I re-watched the FOMC January meetings by J Pow and he appears to be very serious about curbing inflation rates, I think because of the higher than expected CPI data this Wednesday J Pow will be very hawkish or atleast appear to be so (if he acts the same way he acted in the January meeting).

I think he may even announce the possible pushback of the rate-cuts that were planned to materialize in June/July this year, I don't think he will announce any interest increases and probably keep them steady where they are now

I'm going to buy 3/22 calls on the SQQQ at market close Tuesday and plan to sell them just before market close on Wednesday, right after J Pow speaks and gives his outlook at 2:30 pm. I think the market is going to be bullish on Monday and Tuesday due to Nvidia's GTC event (I've bought NVIDIA shares that I plan to sell Tuesday and will re-enter again after the dip) affording me an even better price for SQQQ (as it returns -3x the NASDAQ 100)

The best DD on $GOOS,"Canada Goose (GOOS) grew its revenue and stock price like crazy until 2018. Then CEO Dani Reiss changed strategy to focus on direct to consumer and non-winter luxury fashion products. It worked well for their competitor Moncler and the ideas were popular generally. Also, why not cash in on the brand's popularity year-round instead of just selling winter coats? 

Meanwhile, lower priced brands like Moose Knuckles and Arc'teryx were on the rise. So it was easier for GOOS to move upward to luxury and compete more directly with Moncler. But the company still sells it's durable and functional parkas to governments, businesses, and the public. So the risky move upward is countered by a solid recurring (albeit seasonal) business.

Just to be clear, the company took on three simultaneous transformations. First, it switched from primarily wholesale to primarily DTC. Second, it switched from primarily functional heavy weight down to a broad product offering that can be worn year round (like shoes, T-shirts, etc). Third, it switched from durable and functional to artistic products made in limited quantities in collaboration with various artists and fashion designers. That's a lot for any company to take on simultaneously. And it came with its costs for Canada Goose.

Customers and investors didn't like the initial results of those changes. Customers complained about product quality (less goose down fill was seen as low quality) and price increases. The lightweight jackets and apparel contrasted with the heavy duty parkas in a way that made them seem lower quality. The fashion aspect wasn't creating enough appeal to offset those changes for functionality-minded customers either. 

Investors saw revenue growth slow, and operational costs and inventory soar. Wholesale revenue shrunk as the company discontinued existing relationships to focus on direct to consumer. They only kept the wholesalers who made the Canada Goose brand more valuable. This immediately started to impact revenue growth and still does. Luckily last earnings call management said they will grow wholesale alongside DTC from here if it is brand accretive. This self inflicted recession by Canada Goose was bigger than any actual recreation would impact them.

That combined with the push to luxury fashion, increased marketing, leasing, and construction costs. Inventory went up partially because of failed fashion experiments, but mostly because of warm winters and work from home. So slower sales growth, tighter margins, and higher inventory made investors lose interest, but they were intentional sacrifices to benefit the brand long term.

Direct to consumer doesn't work certain products (like mattresses - remember Casper?) but it does for Moncler and Apple. No one sees what brand mattress you sleep on, but they do see what coat or fashion you wear. So brands are stronger in fashion apparel, especially outdoor fashion apparel. Both Moncler and Apple retail locations showcase their products like jewelry showrooms. 

So that's the direct to consumer vision GOOS adopted for their retail stores. It takes a lot of upfront investment to build such stores, and a lot of temporary operational expenses experimenting with marketing and products. SG&A expenses also went up and those are not as temporary. The company needs to have the corporate roles that make a retail operation successful. 

And it's worth it for Canada Goose, because their stores already average $4,000 per square foot vs only $1,600 at Lululemon. The added SG&A expenses are to take that store productivity even higher. Once the company gets it right and streamlines operations, the excess expenses and margin contraction are history.

That's exactly the inflection point Canada Goose is at now. Their sales were up 40% on Black Friday weekend and their stores saw record traffic (brand is strong). However, temperatures rose to the mid 40s and 50s in the Northern US/Canada by mid December due to El Nino. But the winds are a changin'! On Thursday, the National Weather Service predicted ([https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/analysis\_monitoring/enso\_advisory/ensodisc.shtml](https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/analysis_monitoring/enso_advisory/ensodisc.shtml)) that the next winter is likely to be a cold one. The line to get in at my local Canada Goose store used to be 2 hours long during cold winters!

Moreover, work from home is slowly reversing. Everyone I talk to from programmers to business roles and lawyers, reports having to go into work more often this year vs last year. It's clear that most companies don't like work from home. Going into work means everyone has to wear their coats more often. With the extra wear and tear, they need to buy new ones for the colder winter next year. Also lots of people haven't needed to buy a heavy winter coat since before COVID. GOOS will sell a ton more coats next year. But we don't have to wait until then.

Their rain wear, sweaters, shirts, and accessories are selling better this year than last year already. These are higher margin and their fastest growing category. I talked to one of their store employees today about a range of topics, and this was the most surprising part. Despite the push into non-winter wear since way back in 2018, they are now beating their sales targets on these items. Dude was super cool and genuinely enthusiastic about the brand. My guess is it took them a while to understand what customers want in these categories and how to market to them. With the experiments out of the way and their higher margin categories growing the fastest, the business becomes less seasonal, revenue grows faster, and margins expand. 

Furthermore, there is legitimate speculation ([https://x.com/NonGaap/status/1757928725608530307?s=20](https://x.com/NonGaap/status/1757928725608530307?s=20)) that the company is about to be acquired. The largest shareholder of GOOS is Bain Capital and they own almost 40% of the company. Recently Bain Capital started moving their shares into a shell company that looks like it was used to take out a margin loan against their shares. As the shares have dropped in value, they had to post more and more shares as collateral for that debt. They are getting close to running out of shares to post.

At the same time, Bain Capital have changed their appointed director on the board and ""appointed an experienced operating partner \[Beth Clymer - formerly at Bain Capital\] to run point on finance & strategy."" (quote from the tweet above) GOOS acquired their European supplier shortly after the new board member and Beth were appointed. Now the company has full vertical integration internationally. These are not coincidences. Bain needs an exit and the company is cheap and ripe (in terms of inflection point) for acquisition.

But forget the probability of an acquisition and let's say I'm too optimistic about its future. This business just performs. It will growrevenue 10% this fiscal year while most luxury brands will struggle to not shrink. Not to mention that this period included a really warm winter. They are cashflow positive almost every year since IPO (including this year). They grew revenue every year by double digits since IPO except for 2020 (COVID) despite all the challenging factors I listed above. Revenue, income, and cashflow are all up more than 3x since IPO.

The balance sheet and dilution side looks great too. The company hasn't taken on any additional long term debt since way before COVID. They have bought back more than 10% of the company since going public. CEO Dani Reiss is a grandson of the founder and owns almost 25% of the company. And somehow their market cap is below what it was when they IPO'd? I rest my case.",wallstreetbets,https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bgp5lo/the_best_dd_on_goos/,2024-03-17 00:31:55,0.13310863519196853,0.41256259172925835,0.042,0.107,0.998

Why don’t I hear more about saddling here? ,"I have been lurking here for a few years now. I’m getting in to trading options myself and I am wondering why I don’t hear more about straddles/strangles* (thank you u/KAY-toe for the right terms) here? 

It seems like alot of y’all deal with volatile stocks for the most part. I’m curious if anyone has tried buying calls and puts against a stock at the same time during very volatile trading weeks (like this week.) 

Example: 

TSLA fell hard this week - but it’s impossible to know for sure if this is the true bottom, or if it will suddenly shoot back up next week as people try to buy the dip. 

Since it’s likely to swing hard either way next week - why not buy both calls and puts on it? 


Set limits so that you auto sell at 2x investment, or if it falls below 1.5x investment. 

Obviously one will fail, but it’s unlikely that both will fail. And assuming it does work out, you’re likely to at least break even, if not profit quite a bit depending on how far the stock swings either way. 

The only way it seems like you’d lose major money is if the stock has a relatively flat week. But there’s many popular stocks here where flat weeks don’t seem to be that common. 

Obviously you’d make less per stock but at volume maybe it would be statistically safer?

Just curious if anyone has experience with this strategy (if it could be called that at all.)

I am talking about Straddle/Strangles, not Saddles. I fucked that one up but I am still curious to hear people’s experiences regardless.

Inflation was on a steady downward trajectory, and he could ease off the hawkishness. He packed the dovishness peace pipe and passed it around to Mr. Market and all his homies. But Jpow fucked it and packed the bowl with some nasty green meth. Bullishness and speculative behavior exploded like Tuco's temper. Financial conditions loosened to the extent that now we have the easiest money since before interest rate hikes even began!
  
Jpow observes the party getting out of hand, and as we all know, it is the Fed's job to take the meth laced peace pipe out of the circle just as the party is getting started. Loose financial conditions have led to a resurgence in inflation. And not just consumer facing inflation, but producer price inflation too, which leads the consumer rate, since price increases flow down the production chain.
  
So now he's thinking well fuck. If I wait to fix this fuckup too long, inflation risks running away again, and then someone will take my smug, private equity mask off and show the world I was Burns this whole time. He doesn't want to raise rates because the US government can't keep high interest rates and high debt loads forever. So he's going to fuck your calls. 
  
Wednesday afternoon, he's coming out maximum hawkish. Like Jackson Hole hawkish. He knows if he doesn't he'll miss the last free opportunity to tighten financial conditions without a rate hike. 
  
If he has to choose between a guaranteed stagflationary hard landing and a 20% haircut in indexes, he'll take the latter every time.

My (ALMOST) Invincible Call Credit Spread Strategy,"I got a shit ton of interest on a different thread and in my DMs, so I'm going to post this. I should be selling this, really. I'll probably delete this later.

Let me caveat by saying this: I am working on a degree in mathematics and my father taught me how to paper trade when I was only 6 or 7, I've been doing this for 20 years, but I only created this strategy a couple months ago. I say created because every formula I use to calculate my shit is self-made. My math isn't perfect yet. I'm also **NOT** a financial advisor. Please don't take this as advice.

TL;DR. Basically, I sell call credit spreads way out of the money on earnings week on stocks that aren't really great based on traditional technical analysis. If you don't know how this works, or how to do technical analysis, that's a completely separate chunk of information. Some may call this ""picking up pennies in front of a steamroller"" but I wouldn't call what I'm making "" pennies."" and I wouldn't call stocks like Dollar General, Dollar Tree, and Ulta Beauty ""steamrollers"", but ok.

Ok, ready? Good. I'm gonna post this picture - my model - and explain what each line means. Then, I'm gonna explain how I use the info.

[Call Credit Spread Model - 3\/18 - 3\/22](https://preview.redd.it/v8hqq7br2roc1.png?width=1770&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e7df34d32489cad27bfb99cece56395fde66c91)

1. Line 1-3: Stock Info. This should be self-explanatory. The O/price avg is the sum of the at the midpoint of the at the money (ATM) call and ATM put. I use this to calculate the Implied movement (IM) in line 8.
2. Line 4-7: Credit Spread Info. This is info on the actual credit spread I'm potentially going to sell. SL=Price of the Short Leg; LL=Price of the Long Leg; Premium = how much premium I expect to get for selling the spread. SL Delta = Delta of the short leg. SL Delta is important because, for many mathematical reasons, it tells you the rough probability of your buyer being successful. ex. LULU 585/595 the buyer would have a 4% chance of being successful. I use the short leg because if the price of the stock goes above my short leg, I start to lose money, and that's no bueno.
3. Line 8-11: Stats. These are where I start to use my own formulas to determine whether I actually think it's a good idea. Gain = % portfolio gain expected if you sell the spread and win. IM = Implied Movement of the stock during earnings week. % to loss = how much the stock has to go up to cross the short leg and lose money. IM/Loss Ratio = how many times more than the IM the stock would have to move to cross my short leg.
4. Line 12-14: My Scores. My safety score is calculated using by weighing the Delta and IM/loss ratio, taking into account the width of the spread as a percentage of the stock price. It's not out of 100, but the higher the better. My Risk/Reward Score is based on the mathematical concept of fair wagering based on the odds of loss. ex. if a wager is 50/50, the winner should receive back 200% of their wager; however, in a 90/10 wager, The one with a 90% chance to win should receive back only 111.1% of their wager. I use the inverse of the delta to determine the ""ideal"" reward (options are never ideal) and compare it to the actual reward for selling the spread. This one IS out of 100, So that LULU 585/595 spread is 71.7% of ideal.
5. Misc. If you really want to know what this is, you can probably figure it out. I use it more in my put selling model. Also, I have META listed as a control, since sometimes earnings stocks can be weird, just to make sure my model is working correctly.

Ok, so every weekend, I compile my list, then, I take the ones with the best ""Dave Score"" (I wasn't planning on posting this, so I didn't get too creative) and go look at the stock. Generally, If I am actually bearish on a stock, I'll pull the trigger Monday at open. If I am generally bullish on the stock, I pull the trigger as close to the closing bell before they report earnings. Why? If a stock has bullish momentum, the IV is gonna skyrocket exponentially until the report, and the stock is likely to go up pre-earnings too. So, it's better to wait.

You might ask: Why do you use a bearish strategy even if you're bullish? Simple. People are regarded. They pay way too fucking much for options the week of earnings. If someone is willing to pay for call options 30% out of the money on an overvalued company, who am I to deny them? 1 or 2 out of 100 times, they win. That's why I use that analysis to decide which ones are most likely to win for me. And indeed, I have won. All of them. About 25 total trades in a row out of 70-ish that I've analyzed. ONE of those 70 would have lost (DELL). But my model saw it coming, so i stayed away. I've made anywhere from 3-15% per week depending on how many of these I run per week. I started almost 3 months ago.

This is how my model looked when it was just a baby about a month ago - before I optimized it and did primarily earnings.

[My first real model](https://preview.redd.it/fqtodglqeroc1.png?width=697&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2bb1e0a934bff298fec5dd2bf008be27c07db9d)

[If any of you are planning on buying these LULU calls from me, I suggest not doing it.](https://preview.redd.it/aw65n4b89roc1.png?width=1417&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e0d66a08af156234074f9aadd7ee086e68a0253)

Why call credit spreads and not put credit spreads? Because people are generally bullish on literally everything.

Will this eventually fail? Mathematically, yes. Over a long enough timeframe and enough samples, anything will fail. That's why I made the model, to keep me as far away from failure as possible until I have enough money to have financial freedom. Hopefully I only have to do this a couple more months. It's not sustainable forever. Should you do it? It's not guaranteed, but sure, I don't care. If you want to use my model this week, go ahead.

If you have questions, DM me. If you want me to make a course so you can buy it from me, DM me. I'm not gonna make a course, but it will make me laugh.

Good luck and happy trading.

"Went full regard on calls, which ones should print?","Hello fellow regards, I went full regard on NVDA, TSM calls for next week GTC and TSM earnings in a month. Planning to get rid of NVDA calls after GTC if there is a high jump in the stock and it reaches 975-1000 level. For TSM, not sure if I am holding until earnings or selling before, I'll see based on how the stock moves. They should have their March earnings report come out too so that could be a good catalyst if it is good. Might lose some money of 200/220 4/19c's but those were bought just to have more shares to control for cheaper never meant to be held until expiration. 

Along with these, I also jumped on the MSTR hype train with the short squeeze going on and the stock growing parabolic due to HF's having to buying the stock back to cut their losses. Was planning to sell this before the weekend to avoid theta, was 1k up on the call too but did not have my device to sell it so couldnt go thru with it. Planning to get out of it this week if MSTR does really good, else might try to breakeven if not.

I also got some ORCL calls for their earnings. Since they were far OTM they got IV crushed. I was up 1k on them at one point but decided to hold for the NVDA conference due to their ""exciting partnership with NVDA in upcoming week"" announcement. Will sell the 140c's if the stock goes high due to the announcement, might get rid of most of 150c's too but will hold onto 160c's I think.

My route to 200k,"Hi Regards,

I'll just go ahead and dive in head first:

I've been cooking up an options trading strategy focused on the earnings reports, and I'm laying it all out here, looking for your legendary insights, roasts, and wisdom. 🚀🌕

### The Core of My Strategy:

**1.** It's all about **playing call options** around earnings reports, targeting companies 2-3 weeks out from their big day. Puts? Nah, they're off the table due to less appealing risk/reward vibes considering capped earnings potential. If anything I would only revisit that idea in june where that seems to be the least ER releases.

**2.** Keeping an eye on the **VIX** (and put-call ratio + a/d line) to gauge market mood swings. A high VIX might spell out more opportunities, but it's also sus.

**3.** **200-day MA** is my compass, guiding me through the stock's trend. Plus, comparing the stock's current stance against **analyst price targets** to sniff out underpriced gems. I am thinking of using Earnings Wisper. (because I'm not using my crack money)

# 4. Timing is the key – I plan to exit just before earnings are announced. Trying to sidestep the ""sell the news"" trap that seems to catch the crowd off-guard and gain on the anticipation and the new open interest driving the calls price up. Only need +50%. 

**5.** With a starting war chest of $1,600, I'm throwing in an additional $1k each month. Targeting a **5% risk per trade**, eyeing a **1.5 risk-reward ratio**. Aiming for up to 12 trades a month, given that not every week is Christmas during earnings season.

### This strategy isn't set in stone. I’m on a quest for knowledge

### What I'm Looking For:

* **Your Experience:** Ever danced this dance before? How'd it go?
* **Pitfalls:** Any ""gotchas"" or common traps I might be overlooking?
* **Optimization Tips:** How can I sharpen my strategy? Any tools, indicators, or resources you swear by?

I'm all ears and ready to learn from the best (and the worst). This is essentially everything i have learned from trading maybe \~3 months every day on SPY and losing money so I wanted to try something new.

How the Federal Reserve Could Throw Stocks for a Loop,"As of midday Friday, the S&P 500 index had declined just 0.2% for the week, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.1% and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.7%.

While stocks didn’t freak out about inflation, other financial markets certainly reacted. The federal-funds futures market reflects just a 58% chance that the Fed will cut interest rates at least once—by July. At the end of December, there was a 75% chance of at least one cut by March.

What’s more, the two-year Treasury yield, a barometer for expectations about the fed-funds rate, is up more than 30 basis points for the year, to 4.7%. The last time it was at this level, in early December, the S&P 500 was 11% lower. (A basis point is 1/100th of a percentage point.)

The stock market is ignoring these troublesome signals—and the Fed may have to provide a wake-up call at its monetary policy meeting, which ends this coming Wednesday. Almost no one expects the Fed to actually do anything—there’s a 99% chance it leaves rates right where they are—but it’s the signals about the future investors should worry about. The current “dot plot” suggests three cuts this year, but it’s possible that could change.

“The Fed’s policy meeting next week could be a highly consequential one,” writes Thierry Wizman, global foreign exchange and rates strategist at Macquarie, who notes it could “formally extend the wait-and-see period.”

If the Fed officially dashes hopes of rate cuts this year, the market would be, well, unthrilled. “We expect price action to be quite volatile as we believe that investors are placing too much emphasis on the timing and magnitude of potential Fed rate cuts, with market expectations and Fed speak seemingly at odds at the current moment,” writes Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at BMO Capital Markets. “We do not view the current pace of U.S. stock market gains as sustainable.”

The counterargument is that, under the surface, the market is showing signs that it can remain hot. More than 60% of stocks on the S&P 500 have notched gains this year, according to FactSet, so the index isn’t so reliant on a handful of Big Tech names to stay afloat. With inflation still pretty hot and commodity prices up this past week, the index’s energy and materials sectors gained. Even consumer staples, which broadly have strong pricing power, are flat for the week, outperforming the index.

"Everybody calm down with the boom or bust scenarios. This year should be fine. Not great, but not bad either.","The outlook for the U.S. economy in 2024 presents a complex picture, characterized by a mix of cautious optimism and emerging challenges. The economy is expected to see a slowdown in growth, but with a potential for a soft landing, indicating a more moderate pace of expansion without entering a recession. Here’s a synthesis of the key points from several sources:

	1.	Economic Growth: The U.S. economy is likely to experience deceleration in 2024 as the effects of monetary policy become more pronounced and post-pandemic tailwinds diminish. Real GDP growth is forecasted to slow down, with consumer spending expected to increase at a more subdued rate. Business investment and housing activity might see some improvement but will likely remain muted due to higher interest rates .
	2.	Federal Reserve Policies: The Federal Reserve’s policy rates are expected to be on hold at 5.25%-5.5% until the middle of 2024. Subsequently, assuming inflation continues its moderating trajectory, there might be rate cuts starting in June, aiming for a target range of 4.00%-4.25% by the end of 2024 .
	3.	Consumer Spending and Labor Markets: Consumer spending growth is expected to slow down due to factors like diminished excess savings and plateauing wage gains. However, the tight labor market continues to support employment and income levels, suggesting that consumer spending growth, while slower, could remain positive. The labor market is showing signs of normalization, with unemployment potentially drifting higher but staying low in a historical context .
	4.	Inflation and Interest Rates: Inflation is expected to continue its steady downward trend, with forecasts suggesting 2% growth, 2% inflation, and an unemployment rate staying at roughly 4%. The demand in the economy is gradually easing following a strong 2023, but consumer spending is expected to grow more slowly as job gains diminish and banks tighten lending standards [oai_citation:4,

  | J.P. Morgan Asset Management

	4.	](https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/insights/market-insights/investment-outlook/us-economic-outlook/).
	5.	Risks and Challenges: The factors that have driven the resilience of the U.S. economy in 2023, such as robust consumer spending and financial liquidity, could recede in 2024. This poses risks to the bullish outlook on U.S. stocks, highlighting the need for caution among investors regarding high equity valuations and the potential for interest rates to remain higher for longer .

TLDR… the U.S. economy in 2024 is poised for a year of moderated growth and potential soft landing, with a focus on managing inflation and interest rates. Challenges such as slowing consumer spending and the impact of higher interest rates on investment and housing will require careful navigation, but there are also opportunities for positive outcomes if policy measures are effectively implemented.",wallstreetbets,https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bfrtl2/everybody_calm_down_with_the_boom_or_bust/,2024-03-15 19:30:28,0.031015979904868787,0.48384693495804615,0.05,0.223,0.9983

FOMC will be a bullish event,"People are worried that the last hot CPI and PPI readings will translate to a hawkish Powell this upcoming FOMC. Market currently expects 3 rate cuts with a cut starting in June. This FOMC will have dot plots that will clearly show if the market is wrong on that call.

Regardless of how many rate cuts the dot plot suggests, I don't think it matters. This whole year we went from pricing in 7 rate cuts to now 3 and the market still has gone up. Will it make a difference if we go from 3 to potentially 2? I don't think so.

Jerome has been dovish for a while now. He seems to be confident that inflation is still trending down and insists that rate cuts will happen before hitting the 2% target. I don't expect him to suddenly turn hawkish. He will likely use words like ""bumpy"" to describe path of inflation meaning he believes these recent readings are kind of a fluke or blame lags in housing.

NVIDIA Collaborates with Intel to Address AI Chip Supply Constraints,"NVIDIA is facing constraints in AI chip supply due to limited CoWoS advanced packaging production capacity at TSMC. To address this, NVIDIA is collaborating with Intel, which will provide about 5,000 units of monthly capacity for advanced packaging services, potentially starting in the second quarter of 2024. Industry sources suggest that Intel's involvement will help alleviate the tight supply of AI chips. Despite Intel's contribution, TSMC remains NVIDIA's primary supplier for advanced packaging, supplying approximately 90% of the capacity. TSMC is ramping up its production capacity, expected to reach nearly 50,000 units in the first quarter of the year. While Intel's capacity accounts for about 10% of the total, it's not involved in NVIDIA's AI chip foundry orders. Intel is expanding its advanced packaging capabilities, offering customers production flexibility with its solutions. The previous shortage of AI chips was attributed to insufficient advanced packaging capacity, tight supply of high-bandwidth memory (HBM3), and duplicate orders from cloud service providers, which are gradually being resolved.

NVDA lead times narrowing increasing Q2 profits,"Inching closer to eliminating lead times means Nvidia is also getting closer to the end of its AI boom, and that's something neither Nvidia nor investors want. However, if the decline in lead times is indeed coming from increased production capacity, that means more products are being shipped now and more revenue is being generated – great news for the company and shareholders.

At the current rate, it would seem as if Nvidia will work through its backlog of orders in the next two to three quarters. Once that happens, they will only be shipping against new orders and revenue will likely take a bit of a hit.

Lead times are now in the 3-4 month range, down from 8-11 months late last year.

Due to the Chinese chip restrictions lead times have fallen roughly 5 months. However NVDA is planning on releasing AI chips (specifically for China to fill that gap. This fill further boost profits and bring back the much needed revenue from the Chinese market. So I wouldnt become bullish based on slowing sales when it was limited by politics.

NEVER GIVE UP - $MSTR MIRACLE,"Went full regard and bought MSTR $1710 call on the 14th in the morning at $9700 for a contract. Stock reversed almost immediately and the next day I was down 85%.

Wasn’t looking good with bitcoin so was very close to cutting my losses at $7k but decided to ride it out and go for a walk. Almost bought another contract at $800 just before but didn’t want to get burned even more. Come back and one of the contracts sold for my cost at $5500 and I let the other one ride to $7500 before selling. They ended up topping out at $10k each, so I missed out on about $7k, but feeling VERY happy that I was able to turn around a significant loss into a decent gain.

"General Mills (GIS), the cereal of AI, and robots need to eat breakfast too","Hello friends and enemies, I am here to provide you all with the biggest break of next week’s earnings. Remember, the government recently suggested that Americans eat cereal for dinner, as prices at restaurants and grocery stores  are becoming too expensive for the average family. In fact, one analyst recently said General Mills intrinsic value is potentially 97% above its share price! [smart dude](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/general-mills-inc-nyse-gis-130010437))

 Did you know General Mills ramped up its data and digital efforts in recent years as it pushed to create more personalized experiences for customers, drive innovation and improve time to market? A multiyear shift to cloud and tighter relationships between technology and business teams have prepared the $20 billion food giant to move quickly in a changing consumer landscape and embrace new technologies like generative AI.

“We’re fulfilling a promise in terms of helping our business be able to make better decisions faster,” said Chief Digital and Technology Officer Jaime Montemayor, who oversees the transformation effort. That speed is critical as the 157-year-old maker of Cheerios cereal and Gold Medal flour, among other products, navigates an environment where economic shifts and changing preferences can significantly affect performance.

The change program covers five areas:

Cloud. Except for a small handful of systems intentionally kept in data centers or edge locations, nearly 100% of the company’s workloads are running in Google’s cloud environment.

API-based architecture. The ongoing move away from monolithic systems to more flexible architecture has made it faster and easier to connect capabilities across different environments, helping improve speed to market.

Talent. General Mills has grown its ranks of data scientists and launched upskilling opportunities in areas such as AI, machine learning and cloud. It’s also evaluating its recruiting and onboarding processes and giving managers new tools and training as they lead a hybrid workforce around the globe.

Ways of working. The company is making steady progress in its efforts to scale agile ways of working and shift to a product-oriented operating model. The Digital & Technology organization first established product teams in 2012, and 40% of the group’s function was organized into these teams by 2019. A few years later, General Mills introduced “product pods” focused specifically on data and analytics. These cross-functional teams of eight to 12 employees include Digital & Technology team members alongside business partners. The number of pods has grown from four to 42, with more launching soon.

Operating model. This focuses on governance, funding, engagement and connectivity across the Digital & Technology group. Engagement teams are now stationed closer to segment and functional leadership to tighten the partnership between technical and business teams and direct investment toward the highest value initiatives. “More than ever, we need to be thinking in much closer partnership with the business,” Montemayor said.

The company’s investments in its talent and technology foundations have allowed General Mills to maintain customer service while reducing working capital, he added. It is now processing data from a wider range of sources to better understand customers and deliver more personalized messaging. It is also in the middle of a multiyear effort to digitize its supply chain, which allows it to pull more insights from its transaction data, improve planning and logistics, and reduce waste.

A more modern technology stack has also enabled General Mills to expand its use of artificial intelligence. Montemayor splits AI work into two categories: core AI and generative AI. Core AI refers to the company’s ongoing use of machine learning, which includes thousands of models in production across the company.

As generative AI began to grab attention, the company early on created a cross-functional AI task force to create thoughtful governance structures and mitigate risk. That group introduced common standards for generative AI use as well as an interactive decision tree to help employees understand how best to use genAI for work. source ([FORBES](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevennorton/2024/03/04/general-mills-lays-the-foundation-for-an-ai-driven-future/?sh=51071c51c8f6)

* The 155mm rounds are used by the M-777 howitzer. American excess inventories of the currently fielded M-777 howitzer are exhausted, all have been sent to Ukraine- mostly came from deactivated Marine Corps cannon units. 

**Shells & Howitzers Sent Already**


* Jan 2023 - The United States has provided about 1,000,000 projectiles to Ukraine. 

* Jan 2023 - DOD says it has sent 5,200 ""precision-guided 155 mm artillery rounds"" to Ukraine. Assuming these are all Excalibur, then it will take 84 months (7 years) to replace the inventory at the recent production rate and 48 months (4 years) at the surge rate.

* April 2023 - Pentagon says it has sent more than 160 155 mm howitzers, more than 1.5 million 155 mm rounds, more than 6,500 precision-guided 155 mm rounds and more than 14,000 155 mm Remote Anti-Armor Mine (RAAM) Systems

* In total, Ukraine has received approximately 300 pieces of towed and self-propelled 155 mm artillery. Actual numbers likely much higher.  

* M-777 is not currently in US production. Although the Army may restart M-777 production (I highly doubt it), delivery of new systems would take many years.

* Other countries have also provided howitzers, but Kyiv has continually asks for more.


**155mm Production Rate**


* In Jan 2023, 155mm US production was 3,250 per month. DOD said (2023) that it can get that rate up to 20,000 per month (240,000 per year) by the spring of 2023 and 40,000 per month (480,000 per year) by 2025.

* In March 2024 - ""Collectively, the US and Europe have the capacity to generate only about 1.2 million munitions annually to send to Kyiv"" also March 2024 - The US military set a goal to produce 100,000 rounds of artillery a month by the end of 2025.

* March 2024 - Russia is producing about 250,000 artillery munitions per month, or about 3 million a year, according to NATO intelligence estimates 

* Currently, about a third of Europe's production of 155mm artillery ordnance is handled by the Czech-based CSG. It now produces about 80,000 to 100,000 shells annually but last year sought to expand that number to 150,000.

* Jan 2023 - DOD says it has sent 5,200 ""precision-guided 155 mm artillery rounds"" to Ukraine. Assuming these are all Excalibur, then it will take 84 months (7 years) to replace the inventory at the recent production rate and 48 months (4 years) at the surge rate.

* Feb 2023 - U.S. Army plans to boost its current production rate of around 14,000 155-millimeter howitzer shells per month to 20,000 by this spring and as many as 90,000 by 2025, spending $1.9 billion this year alone in the process.

* Nov 2022 - IMT Defense Corporation ( IMT Group),* Westerville, Ohio, was awarded a $391,015,040 firm-fixed-price contract to increase the industrial base to manufacture, assemble, inspect, package and deliver 155 mm artillery M795 projectile metal parts assemblies. In 2020 IMT could produce 1500 shells per day.   

* 2023 - The Scranton plant is contracted to crank out 11,040 shells per month. The plant is owned by the Army but is operated by General Dynamics Corp.’s ordnance unit and currently runs 24 hours a day, five days a week with a weekend shift. Each day, trucks deliver 20-foot-long steel rods weighing 2,000 pounds to the factory (2023) Scranton and its sister-facility in nearby Wilkes-Barre have received more than $420 million in federal funding for a new building, additional equipment and improved automation that the Army hopes will boost production rates.
 
* 2023 - Douglas Bush, an assistant secretary of the Army who is the service’s top acquisition official, said the Army might establish a new 155-millimeter assembly line in Texas and has invested $68 million in Canada (IMT). Spoiler: They did. 



**155mm Burn Rate**

* April 2023 - In Ukraine, 155 mm rounds are being fired at a rate of 6,000 to 8,000 a day, said Ukrainian parliamentary member Oleksandra Ustinova

* April 2023 - estimated 40,000 Russian variant howitzer rounds fired per day

* Jan 2024 - Kyiv's forces have been firing up to 7,000 rounds each day.

* March 2024 - Officials say Russia is currently firing around 10,000 shells a day, compared to just 2,000 a day from the Ukrainian side.

* Foreign purchases. The United States can buy equipment from foreign countries as it is doing with Czech T-72B tanks and South Korean 155 mm artillery projectiles. To do this, DOD has purchasing teams scouring the globe looking for weapons and munitions that might be suitable for transfer to Ukraine.

* A January 2024 plan to provide more artillery shells to Ukraine by having Japan send munitions to Britain (BAE) has stalled, underscoring the challenge the West faces in increasing Kyiv’s stocks of the much-needed ammunition.

**GD : General Dynamics Corp**

March 6, 2024

* General Dynamics said its board raised the company's quarterly dividend by 10 cents per share, to $1.42 per share.

January 24, 2024

* Fourth-quarter net earnings of $1 billion, diluted EPS of $3.64, on revenue of $11.7 billion
* Highest quarterly EPS and revenue in company history
* $1.2 billion net cash provided by operating activities, or 119% of net earnings
* Ended the quarter with $93.6 billion in backlog

For the full year, net earnings were $3.3 billion, or $12.02 per diluted share. Full-year revenue was $42.3 billion, a 7.3% increase from 2022.



**Backlog of $93.6 billion was the highest year-end backlog in the company’s history. In addition to backlog, estimated potential contract value, representing management’s estimate of additional value in unfunded indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts and unexercised options, was $38.3 billion at year end. Total estimated contract value, the sum of all backlog components, was $132 billion at the end of the year.**

*STILL IN DEVELOPMENT:* 

The Next Generation 155mm Artillery Ammunition Family will include three new projectiles, the XM1113 High Explosive Rocket Assist Projectile, the XM1122E1 High Explosive Projectile and the XM1128 High Explosive Base Bleed. These projectiles can be fired off both the M777A2 Lightweight Towed 155mm Howitzer and the M109A7 Paladin Self- Propelled Howitzer platforms.

https://www.gd-ots.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/155mm-NextGen-202007.pdf

Full rate production of these projectiles will all take place within the next five years.

Q1 Earning in April.

2. Conference shows off what everyone was already expecting so the stock starts tanking on ""sell the news.""

More reasons for Paypal puts,"For some reason everybody on this sub likes to pretend like Paypal is the only name in the game, let's look at Paypal's last earnings report:

* Total Payment Volume YOY: +15% Year over year
* Total Payment Volume: 1.5 trillion

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/07/paypal-pypl-q4-earnings.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/07/paypal-pypl-q4-earnings.html)

&#x200B;

Now lets look at Paypal's 2 biggest competitors:

Adyen:

* Total Payment Volume YOY: 23% Year over year
* Total Payment Volume: $808 Billion

[https://www.adyen.com/press-and-media/adyen-publishes-h1-2023-financial-results](https://www.adyen.com/press-and-media/adyen-publishes-h1-2023-financial-results)

Stripe:

* Total Payment Volume YOY: +25% Year Over Year
* Total Payment Volume: ""Over $1 Trillion"" (they're a private company, so they didn't report exact numbers)

[https://stripe.com/annual-updates/2023](https://stripe.com/annual-updates/2023)

&#x200B;

Paypal is losing active users every single quarter, they're growing at almost half the rate of their biggest competitors, and despite having a decade of first-mover advantage, are about to be surpassed in total payment volume. This is a company that will slowly bleed out. To top it off, both Stripe and Adyen are profitable companies, they're growing at double the speed and still maintaining profitability.

MSTR deep value,"Looks to me like there's two options for MSTR.

1. Bitcoin goes up, they acquire more Bitcoin and get admitted to the S&P500, super bullish because their inflows become structural

2. Bitcoin goes down, they acquire _even more_ Bitcoin, later it gets admitted to the S&P500 whenever the trend reverses, super bullish, just later (see 1)

Unpopular opinion: I am bullish on Reddit IPO & stock,"While I'm snacking on my box of crayons, let me tell you a bit about what I've been observing. There's a lot of hate for the Reddit IPO and people predicting its inevitable demise. These people are wrong. Most of this comes from people just not wanting change - because lets face it, we're all on Reddit, and it's basically the last refuge on the internet for some of the 'oldschool internet' crowd.

Now lets look at some of the other social media networks out there. What do you think is the average age of the typical SNAP / INSTA / TIKTOK user compared to Reddit? Now look at their valuations. SNAP is 20BB. Meta is 1.2T. Reddit's IPO is being priced at 5.XB.

Now lets think about Reddit's product - which is the users. We, on average, are going to be older, and therefore have a higher net worth, more higher level jobs, etc. As an advertising audience, we are a much more valuable product compared to the kids sexting on SNAP. If SNAP is worth 20B, Reddit is going to reach at LEAST that level in a year. Yea, unfortunately it means there will probably be more ads, but hopefully they won't fuck it up to the point where the users bail - and lets face it, there isn't really anywhere else for us to go.

So yea, I'm bullish on Reddit. I've got my IPO allocation in.

Reddit's Love Story With Google Is Likely Making Them A Fuck Ton Of Money,"I've done 2,5 minutes of DD so that should be enough to write an elaborate analysis of the Reddit IPO. 

**TLDR;** Google and Reddit are friends, Reddit is getting 8 times Google's traffic and probably makes fuck tons more money. 

I know the consensus is that Reddit is a garbage platform riddled with bots, an incompetent CEO who changes negative comments about him on the platform himself, and a bunch of power-hungry mods to keep it all under ''control'' as much as you can keep raging wildfire under control. I agree with all of this, and all of this makes me want to short this stock into oblivion as well. 

I have one problem with shorting, and that's Google's and Reddit's newfound love story. As we all know in February Reddit and Google struck a deal that means Google can use all of Reddit's content tot train its AI for $60 million per year. Again, garbage deal-making on the side of Reddit, what's $60 million a year really these days? Anyway, that's not my point. 

My point is what this means for Reddit traffic. Below you can see their traffic fucking skyrocketed in the past months. Coincidence? If you think Google accidentally redirects 100s of millions of users a month to Reddit, you're on an LSD trip. It's because this benefits Google (more users = more user-generated content = more data to train AI). 

For Reddit, 8 times the amount of users means 8 times the amount of ad revenue. Honestly, I know they're incompetent over here, but you'd have to be very highly regarded to not make money out of that. Hell, even if they did nothing at all, they're likely to make metric fuck tons of ad revenue from this. 

I know we just had a guy talk about buying/shorting stock based on web traffic (and another regard that lost money based on that tactic) but in terms of scale this is completely in its own league. Is this a buy?

Probably still shorting though. Never underestimate incompetent leadership.

Adding 300k in calls to my mstr postion,"I already have a bunch of calls on MSTR: Jan 17 2025 $690 (up about 450%), June 21st $1460 and $1660s. I'll be buying more OTM calls for Sept - Jan on dips.

Yes MSTR is overvalued by looking at their PE and balance sheet. Yes, I could just buy bitcoin or ETFs instead (I do). I'm buying mstr bc I see a very large possibility of a massive squeeze / run. Btc is almost guaranteed to go up through 2025 due to the halving and the ETFs. There's a ton of short interest in btc; specifically about 2.5 billion in shorts will get liquidated around 75k in the near future. I believe right now the hedges are shorting btc even more to try and save their asses and suppressing the price. Mstr has about 18% of the float sold short. On Monday we went from 20% to 18% short interest. Btc stayed about the same price during this time and MSTR had a very nice green day. So, what happens when the btc shorts get liquidated and btc flies thru 75k? Mstr goes up and the shorts that haven been short mstr since $500 (who are heavily underwater already) are fucked.

I've been around crypto since 2012, bought my first btc in 2013. I know the cycles it goes thru. This is going to be a very bigger bull run with massive amounts of capital coming into the ETFs from institutional investors. A minimum of $150 billion in inflows is expected this year from the ETFs alone. Buying btc is a no brainer; buying mstr is a gamble on a squeeze. I'm a gambler. 

I'm also up about 400% this year (230k to about a mil) so this is just house money for me.

The most underrated AI stock nobody is buying,"[ SoundHound AI, Inc. is a voice AI and speech recognition company founded in 2005. It develops speech recognition, natural language understanding, sound recognition and search technologies. ](https://preview.redd.it/v7uhcoag2foc1.jpg?width=3124&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e55fc57324ffc891f913acc27d10774b35764646)

SoundHound AI is forecast to increase revenue approximately 50% in both 2024 and 2025, according to Yahoo Finance. Given last year's sales of roughly $46 million, this implies SoundHound AI will reach $100 million in revenue by 2025.

For this analysis, I'll assume that SoundHound AI can keep growing revenue at 50% through 2030. Should the company achieve this level of growth, this would result in $780 million of sales by 2030.

Additionally, SoundHound AI stock recently traded at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 29.3. Assuming this normalizes to a more reasonable level of 15, for example, SoundHound AI's future market cap would be around $11.7 billion.

This is roughly 550% higher than the company's current market cap. This means that a hypothetical investment of $100,000 would be worth $650,000 by 2030 -- far from $1 million.

Nvidia bought almost $3.7 million of SOUN stock last quarter, according to the chip giant's Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing.

Breaking down the TSM posts,"I don't know if its because I am a relatively long time TSM holder (bought first share August 2022 near bottom of 2022 semi conductor crash) or its just the more time I spend here the less cute the stupidity is but the TSM wave has really bothered me recently.

**So we are going to break down the TSM posts.**

**I am going to be arguing that the reasoning you guys have for entering into these TSM trades is shallow and shit and bad and that the string of posts about it are shit and shallow and bad.**

I want to make it clear that **just because someone has bad reasoning doesnt mean they arent ultimately right.** If we were playing Russian roulette and the first guy got a click, empty gun, me happily pulling the trigger believing the same thing will happen for me because it happened for him is shitty reasoning. That does not mean the chamber can't still be empty.

**You can be right but get there the wrong way**

**Post 1** \- [TSM / TSMC - Investing in TSM is investing in America](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1b6n6pd/tsm_tsmc_investing_in_tsm_is_investing_in_america/)

The post starts with the briefest and memiest description of what TSM is you could possibly have and then immediately begins with the speculation. We have havent even established what the company does and already we are gawking at ""them"" (whoever the fuck they are) bidding it up 5%. Then like every APE lurking in this sub **OP  talks about a short squeeze**. **TSM has a short interest of 0.4% btw.**

This is the first paragraph of the first post. red flags should be going up in your mind. if they arent, you might be dumb.

**We go into a brief as fuck description of why we would pick TSM over NVDA, SMCI, ASML, and INTC. note that only 1 of these companies actually does the same thing as TSM and thats INTC.**

Just as an example how shit some of the reasoning are for buying TSM over those companies -

**His entire take for not buying ASML is it can't SQUEEZE because you can't buy it on RH. The short interest on ASMl is 0.22% btw.**

we are like 200 words or less into this post and already we have referenced a short squeeze twice, both times on companies with less than 1% short interest, and compared TSM to a bunch of companies that dont even do the same thing TSM does.

We get around to TSM. Now mind you, he has yet to tell you what TSM even does. And suprise suprise he still doesn't directly tell you here.

**He claims that Samsung needs to fab 5x what TSM does to get the same yield. This is questionable to say the least. on 3nm both companies are struggling with low yield, like 50-60%.** [https://hothardware.com/news/tsmc-samsung-reportedly-struggling-with-3nm-yields](https://hothardware.com/news/tsmc-samsung-reportedly-struggling-with-3nm-yields)

**On 4 NM both companies are about equal, around 80%.** [https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/18/samsung\_tsmc\_processor\_plans/](https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/18/samsung_tsmc_processor_plans/)

then we get a fucking semiconductor FORUM and told to ""do your own research there"".

and finally we are given **his positions.** You should probably be suspicious of someone giving you stock tips on a position **hes already entered for 60k.**

We could have an entire discussion on whether giving stock advice or taking it actually has any value and I could rant about it for awhile but I'll just say Jesse Livermoore, a famous investor, learned early never to take any tips from anyone as they likely already had a position themselves and just wanted you to effect the direction of their trade for their benefit, and never gave his own tips unless he already had a position.

**I'm sorry guys but if you bought a call based on this post alone you are stupid.** You might not like hearing that, but I'm just trying to do you a favor. You have poor literacy, you live in memes, you thrive off shallow pools of information like some degenerate bottom feeder, and you likely lack what it takes to make money actively trading.

He opens the post by saying he hopes you bought calls so if OP wants to try to skate away by saying well i told them to do their own research blah blah. He hopes you listened to him in his 1st post here and bought calls cause look! theyd be up!

**The rest of the post is aggregated SemiWiki (the forum he told you to ""do your own research on"") posts OP read. I want to just quote one -**

Semiwiki User - ""Why TF is Intel building a foundry and will you give  Intel dibs on production? If semi demand drops, they are fucked!""

**He quite literally post stuff PEOPLE ON A FORUM SAID. He does this 3 more times on the post.** its hard to know if those people are themselves posting links to sources because OP doesn't source the posts he got these from.  The one quoted above is 100% just something a forum user wrote that OP posted back to you cause he liked it.

We get OPs takes on Samsung and Intel talent. Samsung nepo baby (no source) Intel boomer graveyard (no source).

**Then he says the word autism a bunch and all the monkeys in this sub clap along.**

&#x200B;

**Again if you didnt go in on the first post but the second post really was the one that got you you sir are a fucking moron. You do not have the cognitive skills to trade actively. Just stop.**

&#x200B;

**The rest of the posts are all just news aggregation**

&#x200B;

Quite literally all any of these posts do is aggregate mostly US new sources on TSM. He likely is just yoinking these off that SemiWiki forum he fucking loves and then reposting them to you for updoots.

**You could have gotten the same thing from the** [**yahoo.com news page on TSMC**](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSM/)**.** It also aggregates news stories for you. Or the google news tab on a search for TSMC.

And as I pointed out on multiple occasions under some of these very same posts -  **TSM is a country halfway across the world in its own timezone with its own news cycle.** For instance when the US news cycle was consumed by reports about TSM getting a 5 billion dollar awarded from US government the Taiwan news cycle had reports about Taiwan officials clarifying the use of deadly force was permissible on unidentified hostile boats and aircraft in its territory, all as China pushed the boundaries of Taiwan's international waters with its ""grey"" zones and multiple Chinese aircraft and ships were detected in Taiwan's territorial space.

All that on a day TSM dropped like 5%. It is difficult to ever really say for certain why a stock falls but to say that had nothing at all to do with it would betray a real ego on the part of the reader. To think there are no better informed more serious traders out there trading in the same stocks as them that might sell based on negative local news.

&#x200B;

**In essence there is nothing wrong here and I dont mean to be mean to OP. You can have a take, make a post, then if people like it update them on news.**

**The problem is with you - if you fell for this and this alone you are stupid.**

&#x200B;

I hope TSM goes up. I own 14.5% of my portfolio as TSM shares at a rather tasty avg price. I own almost the same portion of large cap growth stocks, about 15%. So my portfolio is very TSM heavy. I just couldnt ignore how dumb you guys were being over this though.

**Not once in any of this discussion are the financials of TSM brought up** save 2 sentences about revenues that are only included because they were in the news cycle. The financials are stellar btw, so OP is lucky, but the fact nobody ever bothers to really talk about them is fucking troubling.

I was down 100k all time and Now I’m down 43k all time. I’m one regarded play from making it back. It’s been such a  rollercoaster these past few years.

Use this ON TOP of any financial analysis you've ALREADY DONE. This is a guide for which options are good deals and which options are bad deals. I don't care if you buy puts or calls, that's up to your analysis, but if you do buy them, make sure you choosing ones that are a good deal.

Below is a list of options with their current bid and asking price, with this models estimated bidding prices next to it. The `Est Bid` is it's fair value compared to all of the options, and the `Rel Est Bid` is it's fair value compared to the options with the same expiration.

If you ain't buying Boeing now you're immune to making money,"TL;DR   
$BA 220c May 17th expiry   


1. imagine betting against one of the biggest contractors of the most powerful military in the history of the humankind
2. imagine betting against the company assassinating its whistle-blowers
3. everything is priced in; they can shoot down Elon's Starlink satelites and this shit is gonna move only 0,5% down for a day
4. the sentiment is down meaning none of you clowns are buying it, meaning it's a great fucking news! people are scared, but guess what? nothing worse can happen
5. Boeing has had around five 10-20% uptrend swings in the past year - this time is no different. You don't have to time the market but just buy May expiry and watch the IV go up, the rebound is inevitable
6. Boeing's Starliner is supposed to take on the first-ever crewed flight in early May. Will def not win them the NASA contract as they are months behind but the successful launch will help drive the price action
7. This bold fuck Dave will have to calm the stakeholders with an announcement, they are prolly cooking something up there as we speak
8. I don't give a fuck about your long-term analysis of the management lol. This stock might be shit long-term, idc, the play is short-term

Nvda continues to stay above the bearish $850 price target. People think the whole world is falling apart because of a bad week, but in reality the stock is only down 1.8%. Investors pulled out right before the $1,000 price target, and the stock will probably continue to stay between $850 and $925 until next weeks GTC event. I'm still remaining bullish on the stock, but we need some catalyst next week to hit $1,000 Imo. Due to all the recent breakthroughs in AI technology and the Blackwell architecture getting closer and closer to release, I really don't see how NVDA wont hit $1000. The only thing that could absolutely crush the stock would be the next earnings fallings. Which we all know without a doubt will be up substantially from the last. anyhoo lmk what you guys think.",wallstreetbets,https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1beyllw/a_bullish_take_on_nvda_and_the_coming_gtc_event/,2024-03-14 18:51:57,-0.006322751322751315,0.38552910052910055,0.039,0.018,0.0

It's not over for TSM...,"As a fast food worker I dumped my entire brokerage into TSM calls expiring 4/26 and 5/17 30-40$ OTM around its rise last tuesday-wednesday.

At one point my brokerage had 32k and now it is sitting at a fine 9.5k and probably going to go down even more tommorow. BUT I HAVE auTSM and I WILL NEVER SELL.  


Getting rid of the emotional sides of things and thinking logically, this is a great stock if you bought calls either 4/19 or more out. I am down 20kish but logically TSM follows NVDA and NVDA is having their GTC meeting in a few days and then we have another monthly revenue report from TSM next month and a few days after their earnings. As a regard assuming the GTC only brings good news, TSM will rise at least 3% that day, monthly revenue report next month will boost TSM around 5-8% and then the final kick of the bucket is their earnings which Implied Volatility will certainly rise and boost our calls with a almost guaranteed beat in earnings which will boost the stock 10-12%.   


if you bought calls expiring this month ur fucked

$DG will flush tomorrow and Q1 here's why,"Hello fellow degens,

Dollar General is going to flush tomorrow and all of Q1.

Their earnings call was a joke today. Company is in the trash. Just take a look at any possible sub reddits of maybe people who work there and it's basically a dumpster fire. Turnover must be nuts.

The CEO was explaining how they are trying to suck less in football yards today as an analogy. Hilarious.

Aside from the stores being dirty and disorganized, here is some main points I would like to bring to your attention.

-They are working to open more locations when their competition is closing 1000 stores. I think the market has had enough of the dollar store. People are going to Walmart and using affirm if they are poor. More stores = more operating costs.

-They want to provide fresh produce at stores. Are they really gonna wanna piss money away on this when they want to control the heat at every store and the toilets are already plugged? Lots of spending for probably no reward in my opinion. If a fridge breaks, it ain't cheap to repair. Allegedly port o pottys outside some stores. I rest my case.

-They are already having less SKUS which means less product = most likely less product with markups.

-Getting rid of self check-out with a person to hire at the front. More renovations will cost them more money.

-High theft from staff and customers.

-High staff turnover isn't cheap.

-Logistics is bad, and with more stores it's probably not gonna get better. Bad logistics=shitty produce.

Stock usually tanks day of earnings and then at least two or three at a minimum just looking at the charts so I don't think this one's done flushing.

I'm in about 6 x 155p. 4 for this week and two for next. Tomorrow I will be buying ITM puts about a month or so out at open because I think this has a lot of room to go down. If you want to gamble some FD's I would also recommend the 148p tomorrow.

On top of all of this their competition Dollar Tree tanked again today, which means the sector is dog crap right now. I sweated this position out all day through all the IV crush and their shitty call and it's gonna pay because I'm fucking right.

Your wife's boyfriend shops at Walmart, Costco and Amazon. Buy puts so you don't have to shop here anymore.

-Pablo

TLDR - $DG is going the way of $BBBY

Edit: Don't put in market orders or someone's gonna eat your lunch. Use a limit order ffs.

Crowdstrike vs SentinelOne,"According to stockanalysis.com:

CrowdStrike revenue growth as a percentage from 2017 to 2024:
2017-2018: 125.14%
2018-2019: 110.37%
2019-2020: 92.7% 
2020-2021: 81.64%
2021-2022: 66%
2022-2023: 54.4%
2023-2024: 36.33%

SentinelOne YOY revenue growth as a percentage from 2020 to 2024:
2020-2021: 100%
2021-2022: 120%
2022-2023: 106%
2023-2024: 47%

Please look at the last 4 years comparatively.

I would love to better understand from you fine redditors how a company like SentineOne that outpaces the growth, as a percentage, of a company like CrowdStrike gets completed beat up on earnings to the degree that everyone would expect of a failing company.  

Am I living in the fc*king twilight zone?

I realize the guidance is what the naysayers are hooking into but part of the the guidance is a path to profitability THIS YEAR, the same multi-year path to profitability that Crowdstrike took a number of years of years ago.  If we fast forward a few years, and assuming previous performance is an indicator of future performance, SentinelOne not only becomes as successful and profitable as Crowdstrike but eventually surpasses them and leads in marketshare.

If there’s even an ounce of truth and accuracy to this, everyone should be salivating for the buying opportunity.

It's ok, fear not, for I forgiveth you all.

I bring to you news again from the front-lines of the greatest battle ever to waged in the 21st century - **The AI Chip Wars**

On March 12th the Arm Holdings Expiry was released and employees where free to sell their shares. There were many articles fanning fear that the ARM apocalypse would ensue during this tumultuous week. And the confabulation that Arm's parent company SoftBank would simply UNLOAD billions and billions of shares and simply dilute and pummel the Arm stock into submission.

**BRACE YOURSELF FOR A SELL OFF**

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-12/arm-traders-brace-for-a-selloff-as-lockup-lifts-after-big-rally?embedded-checkout=true](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-12/arm-traders-brace-for-a-selloff-as-lockup-lifts-after-big-rally?embedded-checkout=true)

I was fearful, not going to lie. But I held Diamond hands and decided that I would not hedge or buy puts or short positions for a temporary ""feared"" sell-off.

I am here to tell you. ARM Held - NOT GIVING A DAMN INCH of pull back.

https://preview.redd.it/8i78pewjbcoc1.png?width=1773&format=png&auto=webp&s=d77b922aee33b9d5172b0bfcb27bed7362857ac3

SoftBank protected the ARM Holdings position and did NOT let the stock go below $125. Look at the tiny trade volume standing tall. That GREEN Wall of protection ensued a wonderful and grande blockaide against puts and short sellers and profit takers. In the words of Karp (PLTR) - I love watching short sellers crumble and things about their drug dealers (some shit like that.)

Look at the volume a day / 2 days later. Nothing much. Their is not a major sell off AT ALL. ARM has passed the lock-up period test.

Oh and before we go to the Barron's DD I wanted to share with you something spectacular.

In this video. I want you to realize how profound of a time you are living in where we can do this technology. It is truly mind-blowing. And what you must understand is that ARM is and will be at the forefront of this. The way the robot see's the world, can think about the world and speak and interact with the world will all be done on ARM CPU's and GPU's.

It is truly an amazing time we live in to see the ground floor of these start to take root.

>Arm’s latest advanced chip technology, called Armv9, generates double the royalty rates of its previous Armv8 products. For some high-end processors, which combine more than 100 “cores,” Arm’s designs are now pulling in more than $100 per chip. It’s a massive change from prior generations.

Arm's high-end Chips are earning over $100 per chip. That is a MASSIVE change.

>Cloud server chips based on Arm technology also benefit from the rapid growth in AI with Nvidia using Arm for its GH200 AI Superchip data center systems. A GH200 Superchip can have up to 144 CPU cores and Arm gets paid for each one.  
>  
>The question for investors now is whether the company’s recent financial performance is sustainable.  
>  
>I, for one, am bullish. Arm’s customers have been willing to pay the higher royalty rates, meaning the boost from Armv9 is likely in the early stages. Further, Arm-based cloud server chips from Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, Nvidia, and others will likely generate robust revenue for years.  
>  
>Outside of Nvidia, Arm may be the best fundamental growth story in technology.

**Here are edited highlights from my conversation with Haas:**

>Barron’s: Can you talk about Arm’s opportunities in the cloud server data center market. It looks like this business is starting to take off.  
>  
>When we were privatized, we had an opportunity to look at what to do with our investment dollars. With data centers, we noticed several things that we could do. If you want to put together processors, we were lacking a fabric \[to weave the network together\]. We were lacking certain extension instructions. So we designed CPUs with the right power profile, features, and performance.  
>  
>Then there was a bunch of work that needed to happen in the software ecosystem. The magic moment came when Red Hat announced their Linux distribution for Arm servers. It all came together.  
>  
>**Amazon saw it very early. Roughly half of Amazon’s AWS server additions are now Arm-based.**

&#x200B;

>We also changed our business model. In the past, it would have been crazy to think Arm would someday get paid $100 for each SoC \[system- on-a-chip\]. But that is what we are getting after we priced at 50 cents to $1 per core. If you put in 100 cores, **we are getting north of $100 on these SoCs.**  
>  
>What kind of demand are you seeing for the Nvidia GH200 Grace Hopper AI systems? In the last earnings report, you noted how the GH200 will run some of the most demanding AI applications in the world today.  
>  
>It’s very, very strong. Nvidia is pushing it very hard. What Nvidia has done with Grace Hopper is essentially taken 72 to 144 Arm CPU cores, and bolted it to an H100. **It replaces the x86 implementation. Nvidia has also done all the CUDA driver work for Arm-based CPUs. It’s great for us that Nvidia is shipping it.**  
>  
>What’s the impact to the business going from Armv8 to Armv9? I saw that Armv9 accounted for 15% of royalty revenue in the December quarter from 10% the prior quarter. Is that pace going to keep up?  
>  
>It is. A couple of things to keep in mind on v8 to v9. We’re going to see very, very fast adoption with v9. Everything that we do in servers is v9. It’s more power efficient and has a huge amount of security features.  
>  
>**Then in mobile, premium Android is mostly all v9.** Over the next couple of years, most Android smartphones will move that way. I expect the other alternative operating system on phones to go that way as well.  
>  
>Then you get into the economics. When we went from v7 to v8, **we doubled the royalty rates from about 1%-1.5% to 3%. On v8 to v9, we’ve doubled it again to 5% or close to 6%.**  
>  
>**It’s a huge tailwind for us in royalty growth.** We locked down those v9 contracts in 2020-2021, knowing that starting in 2023, they would start to kick in. Our confidence rate on the sustainability of that is quite high.  
>  
>Intel, under CEO Pat Gelsinger, has prioritized Intel Foundry—**to give the market an alternative to Taiwan Semiconductor.** How did it feel to be on the stage at Intel’s recent Foundry event, and what do you see from that partnership going forward?  
>  
>I think Intel has realized that for Intel Foundry to be successful, they were going to have to look at where Taiwan Semiconductor was shipping a lot of volume. **Intel Foundry executive Stu Pann said 80% of TSMC’s logic wafers have Arm in some shape or form. So partnering with Arm is table stakes for Intel to grow that business.**  
>  
>Quite candidly, when I came on board, it was a little chilly between the two companies. I had a lot of meetings with Pat Gelsinger after I started. **We came to a meeting of the minds that both companies would benefit, and more broadly, the ecosystem would benefit if we partnered closely.**  
>  
>They’ve been great. They’re spending a lot of engineering effort to make sure that the world’s best server chip based on Arm can be built on Intel’s manufacturing process. **On one level, that sounds kind of crazy, but they’re quite committed to it. We would love to see them be successful.**

**So let's recap all that BULLISH goodness.**

* Arm is making over $100 per SOC (System on Chip)
* Nvidia's most high end GPU's are going to be using 144 core ARM chips and ARM is getting paid per  Core
* x86-x64 is getting replaced writ large
* ARM V9 version 3 is just getting started with it's higher royalty rates going from 10% of total revenue to 15% in the previously reported quarter
* AWS and increasingly Azure are using ARM based servers in their data cloud offerings. More power per watt, cheaper and more efficient
* Android is mostly all V9
* Intel is getting friendly with ARM to fab it's chip production to compete with TSM and help out Intell in its continued success.
* ARM Is going into Robotics Next and New AI Edge Devices

Whistleblower Alert: Goldman Sachs and the Apple Card Post-Bankruptcy,"Hey Wall Street vets,

I've got a tale that might pique your interest, especially if you're into the nitty-gritty of corporate conduct and potential market implications. Here’s the skinny:

After declaring bankruptcy in 2020 and having my debts, including an Apple Card balance of around $1200, legally wiped clean, I recently tried reapplying for the Apple Card to rebuild credit and finance some new tech. Surprisingly, I was told my account, with its previous balance, was still active. Multiple calls, promises of callbacks that never happened, and frustrating rounds with customer service later, I was informed that in Goldman Sachs' view, bankruptcy doesn't erase the debt; it just prevents them from collecting it. So, my account remains open with a balance they acknowledge they can't chase.

This doesn't just stop at being unable to clear the account or reapply for their services. It hints at something darker. I suspect Goldman Sachs might be keeping such noncollectable accounts active to inflate their asset sheets, showing significant debt holdings without disclosing their uncollectibility. This practice, if widespread, could mislead investors and regulators about the true financial health of the institution.

I'm now pushing legally to get my account accurately closed. If Goldman Sachs continues to obstruct, further actions will be considered. While I'm not in the stock game and am not here to give financial advice, this situation could be of interest to those who are. There's potential for significant market movement if these practices are proven and publicized.

Update: My attorney sent them a [""  cease-and-desist "" letter](https://imgur.com/a/sNJ6QrD) today. It's a vague generic letter obviously, but it starts the paper trail , if they continue to block my ability to even apply, i will be taking the next steps forward.

Second Update: Here's the law

[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/524](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/524)

and here's a short description of how they're violating this law.

Apple Card, managed by Goldman Sachs, is potentially violating  bankruptcy law, specifically under 11 U.S.C. § 524(a)(2), by treating a  discharged debt as active. This law states that after a debt is  discharged in bankruptcy, creditors cannot attempt to collect on it. By  treating the discharged debt as open, Apple Card may be infringing on  the legal injunction against collecting discharged debts.

3rd Update: I've applied again just to see and record how it's processed on my end.

Here are the screenshots showing I have an Active and Open Account, and then prompts me to add my Active card to my wallet or manage the card... I consider this a violation of the law, an attempt to collect a debt by showing an active an open account with a balance.

You're Daily Dose Of Doomer Porn!,"The fact that soft landing is even still a narrative is laughable. We're quite evidently heading towards a hard landing, here's my prediction. Disclaimer: Doomer Porn.

March Fomc - Fed is considerably more hawkish but still thinks rate cuts are possible. Market rallies on cope.

May Fomc- more bad data has come in(Inflation still above 3%), fed is now planning on 1 rate cuts or keeping flat. Unemployment is rising rapidly. Stocks in absolute blood bath with reality settings in. The difference is now unemployment is rising rapidly and gdp growth is slowing. Many more regional banks are failing.

June Fomc- Inflation is still prevalent,  U.S hasn't quite entered recession yet but GDP growth is really bad and unemployment is skyrocketing. Bank earnings are really starting to hurt and credit cards, auto loans and commercial real estate loans are skyrocketing. JPOW does cut and there is a small copium rally around the cut but stocks end the month lower overall.

July Fomc- Officially in a bad recession. Unemployment and defaults skyrocket, inflation is coming down slightly and major banks are showing signs of failure. Rate cuts come in hard and fast but don't matter because of the state of things.

September Fomc- U.S is still in recession, unemployment and defaults are still high. Rates are at 0 so inflation is coming back. One or 2 major banks have ""failed"" (they get bailed out so not really failed). Congress passes huge economic stimulus package. Raising U.S Debt by 14 trillion. Stocks end month extremely down but start slow and steady Uptrend.

Uptrend continues slow and steady for next 2 years until a U.S debt default and stocks crater again. 

Mind you if China invades Taiwan(Which seems likely to take eyes off of their economy and please the people and spite the West) this happens 10x faster and and is 10x worse.

"Next generation of chips, NVDA vs AMD, looks bad for NVDA","&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/tcw9a7g8hcoc1.png?width=687&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a0cd4bf48b332a113c94189bc5f3d58c8a3af32

AMD's new chips will be a bit better irrespective of price, and will be twice as good per dollar.

If I got something wrong in the table above, tell me so I can cover my short. I also made stats for INTC's new GPU, but it didn't look as good, so I left them off.

NVDA's high price/sales is justified by their huge margins -- 48% -- which they only have because competition has been non-existent. But that won't last, because they don't have a monopoly, TSMC has the monopoly. It isn't rocket science to run ML models on other GPUs, just nobody does because all non-NVDA chips suck (besides TPUs but GOOG is hoarding those because they didn't make enough of them). But anyone else can send TSMC a reasonable design and get their good GPU chip made, and AMD is finally going to do that. I don't know if it will help AMD, they seem richly valued themselves, but AMD over the decades, periodically sprung ahead in having the best offering in the CPU market over INTC and killed INTC's margins and crashed INTC's share price. AMD is about to do that to NVDA in GPUs.

It's time to buy $TSLA ($165). My bull case.,"Current Price: $165.  

I'm a value investor, but TSLA has finally reached a price today ($165) I consider a steal.  Everyone should have at least 1-5% of their portfolio in TSLA at these prices.   No doubt the stock has short term problems.  From slowing China sales, to Hertz dropping it, to slowdown in German production.  And that is already reflected in the price. In 6 months, it’s dropped almost in half from $299 to $165.  But there are some major long term points the market is missing:

Robotaxis.  

I believe there is at least a 50% probability that Tesla has an Nvidia-like moment w/in the next ten years when the first Tesla robotaxis hit the streets. Imagine Tesla makes a car for $20K.  That car then picks up passengers* for nearly 24 hours per day (except when charging itself).  That car could easily generate $50K annually.  That’s a 2.5X annual return for every car they manufacture.  

They made 1.85M cars in 2023.  Up 38% YOY.  If they can grow by 15% (far less than 38%), that's 7.5M cars in 10 years.  Each car (robotaxi) generates $50K+ per year.  That's $375M+ in revenue.  It'd be a virtual cash machine valued (at the lowest) 5+ times revenue.  That's at least a $1.875T Market Cap. 

Other EV Pain is Tesla’s Gain.

Tesla dropped prices largely because they can, unlike the other EV makers. The legacy autos (ie Ford, GM) and even new rivals (ie Rivian) don’t have any margins on EVs yet.  They actually lose money by making them. So the competition is getting frustrated and giving up. That’s making people believe the whole industry is hurt.  But that pain is actually gain for Tesla, in the form of future market share. And it shows just how high a mountain they already climbed.  Nobody else can figure out how to make EVs profitably.  Tesla is one of the best run companies in the world and that’s how they accomplished it. They have some of the best engineers and maintain a very lean operation.  

Fair Value

If you believe that in the next ten years Tesla will be a trillion dollar company, you should buy at these prices.   If we discount at a 5.5% rate, 1,000,000,000 / 1.055^10 = $585M, which would correlate to a Tesla stock price of $184.19 (because there are 3.176M shares outstanding).  I personally believe that Tesla is going to be a $2T or even $3T company.  Discounting the previously mentioned $1.875T market cap would land at a current price of $345.",wallstreetbets,https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1beo0cg/its_time_to_buy_tsla_165_my_bull_case/,2024-03-14 11:34:37,0.06811494061494063,0.3535841935841936,0.08,0.112,0.9337

AI adoption inside of Investment Funds,"Interesting article detailing how AI is currently being adopted at investment funds. Some funds are more advanced than others. The real benefit comes from integrating internal research with AI, which some of the largest funds are doing.  


Other interesting bits from the article:  


 \- Data foundations is very important, funds who are behind in this also struggle to adopt AI

 \- Technical talent is super important - many funds have no technical talent. Those who have a lot are at an advantage.  
 \- ChatGPT can't do everything. It is not great at math, and many quant researchers don't find it very useful  
 \- Privacy concern is real  
 \- RAG works well for most cases and finetuning is rarely necessary  
 \- open source models are experimental and it's mostly OpenAI

$WFC Wells Fargo Rage YOLO and DD I guess.,"Everybody *hates* this bank, but we *love* money, right? So turn the volume down on your morals and let’s get rich.

I’ve been spinning the $WFC Wheel of Doom for a while now. I’ve made money and lost money, but my underlying thesis has not been realized. *Yet*. Let’s get the dirty business out of the way first, I’m in a a truckload of calls. I’ve been preaching this for a while, it’s in my post history, go check it out later.  Below is the workin’-man’s-YOLO-lotto-pick-DD for $WFC. *(If words like “thesis” scare you, there is a TL;DR at the bottom.)*

[My stash](https://preview.redd.it/z8aac90g5boc1.jpg?width=1287&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a2e9f9895a399884db00fac013ad1e2b4b2108e5)

# 

# Key Catalyst:

This is the shit that could be called “facts” in contrast to the brilliant pseudo-knowledge I’ll be spewing in the next section. There are three key catalysts for the current run up and also setting the stage for the “real” run still to come. In descending order of importance:

1. **Dec 2023 Federal Reserve Meeting:** On December 13th the Fed said “Christmas is coming, bitches.” and the market lost its collective mind. What does this mean? Somehow the Fed said .75 in cuts and the market heard 1.5, but that doesn’t matter as much as the underlying message that continues to prove true: *They killed inflation and a recession is unlikely.* The second point is what matters most for banks right now, a recession is *bad* for banks. No recession, lower rates, better environment for lending, all leads to fists full of cash for banks. Huge bump in $WFC price on that news like most of the market.
2. **Shares Outstanding:** What do you do when you’re in the dog house and everyone hates you? *Treat yo self.* Right about the time the Fed made the unprecedented move of telling one of the largest banks in the US it is in time out and has to sit at the kid table, $WFC said money “can” buy happiness and started buying back a metric shit ton of shares. [From the peak EoY 2013 to EoY 2023 they went from 5.27B outstanding to 3.64B.](https://companiesmarketcap.com/wells-fargo/shares-outstanding/) That kind of change matters and is a HUGE win for shareholders and will lead to higher highs. If only something good would happen…
3. **Earnings:** While they haven’t been perfect, they’ve been *really OKish* to good. The bank is making progress on their efficiency ratio, protecting against loan writeoffs, they have very little CRE, blah blah blah *big fucking yawn.* That’s not what this post is about. If you want to study their balance sheet and earning reports go ahead, *I’m proud of you.* But this post is about gambling a shitload of money on when the elephant in the room is going to start shitting gold bricks.
4. **OCC terminated key consent order:** The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency can fucking ruin your day. But they can also make you feel pretty. On Jan 30th 2024 they made $WFC a *beauty queen*, at least for a day, and $WFC went up more than 7% on the news [they finally lifted the 2016 consent order](https://www.occ.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2024/nr-occ-2024-15.html) *“for deficiencies and unsafe or unsound practices in the bank's risk management and oversight of the bank's sales practices, and unsafe or unsound sales practices by the bank. (Docket No. AA-ENF-2024-11)”* This is the one that the Fed, in 2018, said you’re dragging your feet and slapped $WFC across the face with a fat asset cap. Now that it’s terminated, anyone with *half* a brain (most stock analysts) know that it’s only a matter of time until the Fed pats itself on the back and says “Job well done, Fed” and lifts that asset cap.

[This is a good thing](https://preview.redd.it/mjdsrswn5boc1.jpg?width=1366&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fca01c7ff24ab783684b2216454a1cc29b50b3be)

Did you notice there were 4 bullets? *But wait, this idiot said “three key catalyst” WTF?* Yeah, go back and read bullet 3 again. *Nothing* in a quarterly earnings report is going to come close to the move this makes when the Fed deletes the asset cap.

&#x200B;

# Reading the tea leaves:

Ok, I promised you a section of *un-provable* bull case bullshit, so buckle up. This is anecdotal information and unconfirmed rumor, you know, the *best* kind of due diligence.

1. $WFC stock price has been run up like a flag on a poll ever since the OCC lifted the consent order. For those of you that like **technical analysis**, draw your lines on the 1 month chart. $48 to $58 since Feb 15th. While you have the crayons out, check average volume too. This isn’t just retail/stupid money, these are large positions being built every morning for the last 20 trading days.
2. I hadn’t heard an **advertisement for $WFC** on any platform since the “apology” commercial back in 2018, which was very likely the single most [shit for brains campaign](https://newsroom.wf.com/English/news-releases/news-release-details/2018/Wells-Fargo-Launches-Re-Established-a-New-Brand-Campaign/default.aspx) ever in the history of everything. However, now I’ve been hearing non-stop $WFC commercials for personal savings accounts (DDA) and high net worth customers (wealth management). By accepting these types of deposits, they’ll be adding to their consolidated assets under management. *Crazy* if you still have an asset cap imposed by the Fed, or *crazy like a fox* if you know it will be going away before the end of the year.
3. Why the end of the year? It will **take a while to actually bring in cash this way**, and the calculation the Fed used to impose this limit is the following: “*the average of WFC’s total consolidated assets reported in line 5 of Schedule HC-K to the form FR Y-9C for the current calendar quarter and the immediate preceding calendar quarter to exceed the total consolidated assets reported as of December 31, 2017, in line 12 of Schedule HC to the form FR Y-9C.*” (That’s from the *Limits on Growth Section 5.(a)* in the Fed’s Order bitch slapping $WFC.  I’d link it, but it opens a PDF and that’s assault in 29 states.) That means they have *some* wiggle room to at least start taking DDA type deposits. Risky? Maybe. Bullshit? Likely. But *I am* hearing a shitload of commercials.
4. For about a year and a half I’ve been checking the external $WFC **Workday job postings** for any indication of what might be going on. There has definitely been a shift from risk and compliance type postings to wealth management, market analysis and management, account management, etc.. This is about as close as I come to reading tarot cards, but it *has* shifted.
5. Uh, even shitty investor DD sites are talking about it, if you’re into that kind of thing?  Why bother when all the best is in this sub?

&#x200B;

# The Buffett Case Against $WFC:

“*What about Warren Buffett selling his long held position in $WFC?*” – What do you mean? Do you really think the most successful investor in the history of the universe knows more than *me*? First of all, he sold at the *bottom*, so think about that for a minute. A few points to consider:

[This is a silly thing](https://preview.redd.it/49xmp0fp5boc1.jpg?width=1230&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=420fe25a34eb165108f88fc9a9be08c15e2400c2)

1. **Warren Buffett sold his entire stake in $WFC** because he has a “fundamental belief” that [bankers should be held to a very high moral standard](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/charlie-munger-why-still-holds-164425166.html). The fake account scandal demonstrated that the leadership at $WFC did not meet his very high bar of moral character. So he sold.
2. Buffett believed in this enough to [sell 271 million shares below $30 and another 52 million below $40.](https://stockcircle.com/portfolio/warren-buffett/wfc/transactions) That’s impressive **conviction to moral standards** and honestly should be applauded. It would be more impressive if he didn’t still make an absolute killing on $WFC, but he had to have known he was selling at a relatively *temporary* low.
3. **Charlie Munger still owned a shitload of $WFC.** [Munger has a different view](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/charlie-munger-why-still-holds-164425166.html), like you and I he *likes money* and has a more realistic view of the moral character of CEOs.

&#x200B;

# TL:DR

1. “3 Rate cuts and no recession“ – The Fed
2. Shares outstanding went from 5.27 billion in 2013 to 3.64 billion in 2023
3. This DD is not about earnings or balance sheet management
4. **OCC terminated the 2016 shitty sales practice consent order which was the basis for the Fed’s 2018 asset cap**
5. Since OCC termination of CO, $WFC has gone from $48 to $58, this isn’t just retail buying
6. Lots of new $WFC advertising for demand deposit accounts (DDA) and wealth management
7. The timing for new deposits might point to the asset cap being removed by end of year, but probably not
8. $WFC job postings have noticeably transitioned from risk and compliance to wealth management
9. Popular investment websites are beginning to write about the bull case for $WFC
10. Warren Buffett sold $WFC because of personal beliefs about banker’s morals, so much so that he sold at the bottom
11. Charlie Munger likes money and does not give 2 shits about morals, neither do we

Shorting Wendy's - No debate,"Let's talk about Wendy's ($WEN) and why its stock should be in the dumpster behind Wendy's.

Key Events:  
-McDonald’s Stock Falls as Company Says Lower-Income Consumers Are Pulling Back ([Link](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/stock-market-today-dow-jones-03-13-2024/card/mcdonald-s-stock-falls-as-company-says-lower-income-consumers-are-pulling-back-XqnNFTb8dF8MmuKN7UZr?siteid=yhoof2))  
-Surge in Wendy's complaints exposes limits to consumer tolerance of unstable prices  
-JPMorgan Chase & Co. Sells 91,111 Shares of The Wendy's Company (Other institutional investors have also bought and sold shares of the company - Not as significant)  
-Uncertainty due to management change (CDO & CEO) - Already a greedy blunder  
-Lower-income consumers continue to deplete their savings and are shifting their spending habits towards grocery stores rather than dining out. Also stated by McDonald’s CFO Ian Borden  
-I got tired of blowing cash eating out, so I switched to cooking. Aldi saved me $800 while eating good.

For the past two years, Wendy's has consistently ranked around the top five most expensive fast food **options(puts)**.

Current Average Menu Prices ([Pricelisto](https://www.pricelisto.com/menu-prices/wendys))  
McDonald's:$5.60  
KFC:$15.02 (Skewed due to ""Family Sized"" meals)  
TacoBell:$5.08  
Chick-Fil-A:$7.09 (Slight Skew due to ""Trays & Merchandise"")  
**Wendy's**:$6.03

A quick look back at Wendy's 2023 Q4 Earnings - (Upcoming 2024 Q1 Earnings - May 8, Pre-Market)  
**Earnings and Revenue Miss:** Despite a year-over-year uptick in revenue, Wendy's fell short of the Consensus Estimate on both earnings and revenue fronts. Adjusted earnings per share of 21 cents trailed the estimate by 8.7%, while revenues of $540.7 million missed expectations of $546.6 million. The growth stemmed primarily from augmented same-restaurant sales but was counterbalanced by diminished franchise rental income.

**Same-Restaurant Sales:** While Wendy's witnessed a growth trajectory in same-restaurant sales, the figures did not quite meet anticipated levels. Global restaurant comps rose by 1.3% year over year, a notable drop from the 6.4% seen in the previous year's quarter. Similarly, U.S. comps increased by 0.9%, a significant decline from the 5.9% reported in the comparable quarter.

**Operational Challenges:** Operational margins faced pressures from escalated commodity and labor costs, which impacted restaurant margins unfavorably. While there was a slight downturn in general and administrative expenses, it was insufficient to offset other expenditure factors.

**2024 Outlook:** Peering into the future, Wendy's is projecting a conservative growth trajectory in global system-wide sales for 2024, anticipating a range of 5-6%. The company forecasts adjusted EBITDA to fall between $535-$545 million, with adjusted EPS expected in the range of $0.98-$1.02. They won't hit EPS.

BTC Only Has One Leg Left in its Lifespan,"&#x200B;

[This is a logarithmic BTC chart. I have mapped out every bull and every bear cycle.](https://preview.redd.it/k0ttmde1v8oc1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=c5ba310ae7300c1d7e67cb8007a95e9837b705fe)

I've also charted them all here in Google Sheets. It just so happened that both bull cycle 2 and 3 were nearly identical lengths.

As we can see each bull cycle brings less lucrative profits. Starting with 30,0098.56%, then 9257.17% and then the most recent one 1949.89%.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mpmetrn6v8oc1.png?width=179&format=png&auto=webp&s=7644e6061884c6663f61e8813b08c08a15bb3a0d

After that I calculated the dropoff factor for each bull run. The first dropoff factor was 30.7% approx. Which means that the second bull run was only 30.7% as profitable as bull run 1.

The third bull run was only 21% as profitable as bull run 2. This is a 68% dropoff in profitability which I used to get our dropoff factor for the bull run we're currently in. I applied 68% to 21% and got an anticipated dropoff factor of 14.4%.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4f9i5xb9v8oc1.png?width=176&format=png&auto=webp&s=433270044204eaf853daa8f2c0535094beeaec34

14.4% of the previous bull runs profitability (1949.89) leaves us with 281.28%.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gbvzss4av8oc1.png?width=176&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d1e699be733ac6947c59e2b3c3a7b43047df083

With a previous true market top (weekly close) of 65,145 to predict the next bull market top all we would do is multiple this number by 2.8128

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7vgzxoobv8oc1.png?width=150&format=png&auto=webp&s=22142a34aa46518d72c93d26dcb1de531950ba76

Our next ATH prediction is approx 183K USD.

Since this current bull run started on Nov 21, 2022 (Our first week with a green candle since a bear market) we can anticipate an average of 963.66 days until next top. Giving us a projected new ATH date of July 11/2025.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ul1ez8sev8oc1.png?width=245&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0652203b9769e9184a7245424d9e4600bd4e869

The average bear drawdown is 79.64% which means we can predict a bear market low of 37.3K. The average bear market takes approximately 382.66 days leaving us with a projected bear low occurring on July 28, 2026.

Also worth noting that if we continue to see the downtrend of profitability in bull cycles that is projected this will literally be the last bull market.

&#x200B;

Alarmingly for BTC the 5th bull cycle will have a dropoff of 9% profitability when compared to previous cycle. Since the previous cycle will only be 281% profitable bull 5 will only be 27% increase in price.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4umblhemv8oc1.png?width=180&format=png&auto=webp&s=59c5482eeeacefc46c847972b45019f51ba74667

The projected bull 4 cycle market top will be 183,240.90 and 27% of that would be 50,920.70

"The case for small modular nuclear reactors for powering (you guessed it) AI datacenters, and how NuScale Power (SMR) is poised to blow up.","If you're anything like me, you've probably been too busy watching your semiconductor weeklies get flushed down the drain to notice that SMR has been on an upward trajectory for the past month and rocketing for the past week and a half, or really even know who the fuck they are. But don't you worry, I can explain everything, or rather, I can at least paint a picture that even you fellow smooth brains will will be able to wrap your noodles around. Firstly, you'll want to know that [their earnings will be on Thursday March 14th at 5pm](https://www.nuscalepower.com/en/news/press-releases/2024/nuscale-power-to-hold-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2023-earnings-conference-call), I know you degenerates love that shit. [In January they were trading at $2, last week they were at $4](https://www.investorsobserver.com/news/stock-update/nuscale-power-corp-smr-up-3-14-in-premarket-trading)  and today they are over $7. Why is this happening? What the fuck is SMR?

SMR is NuScale Power Corporation and they make Small Modular nuclearReactors. In fact, they are the [first and *only* company that has SMR with NRC design approval](https://www.nuscalepower.com/en/about) ""But what the fuck is that and why would anyone want one?"" you ask? Because the world needs a fuckton of cheap power but no one wants to spend 35 Billion on a fucking nuclear power plant that's why. [These reactors are potentially small enough to fit on a truck](https://wonderfulengineering.com/these-new-truck-mounted-nuclear-reactors-could-provide-power-to-remote-areas/) and the similar tech has been used in nuclear submarines for decades.

Some relevant reading:

More pressingly, he predicts that data centres in the not too distant future will come with their own dedicated, built-in nuclear reactors.

Are you starting to get the picture here? Small modular reactors are the energy source of the future datacenter. Datacenters will *double* by 2030 and they are going to need stupid amounts of power, they need it 24/7, and the reason is to power that sweet, sweet AI we're all creaming over. Lastly, NuScale Power Corp is the currently the only game in SMR town.

Albertsons($ACI) is extremely undervalued,"TL';DR Read title. Earnings is coming 4/9. Cheap Calls 4/19 I like like Albertsons. 

Updated March 15 @ the bottom of dd
Updated March 19 @ bottom

&#x200B;

Just want to say off the rip. Sorry in advance if I sound like I true ""artist"". I had an idiot savant moment a week ago with this stock and have not been able to shake it. This is my first DD so just assume it is going to be ass. Alright let me get to it.

&#x200B;

So I will start off with the bad.

The Merger with Kroger being delayed and now the FTC lawsuit to block the merger. Very bearish, I know. ( I think potentially can end up being bullish rally for the stock the closer to the FTC court date of Aug 26)

Second Albertsons debt is a little high at about 7.9b.

I don't got more bearish shit to say or more bearish shit I can think about. I like the stock too much.

&#x200B;

The Good

Albertsons is the second largest supermarket chain in North America.

Albertsons has a fucking P/E ratio of 8.5

The RSI is pretty blown at the moment (I think this could be close to the bottom for the stock.)

Eps 2.46 TTM

21.98B Gross profit 1.52% over last year

79.2B Revenue 3.12% over last year

1.357B Net income 21% down from last year ( think it was promotional shit they had for customers to gain more interest.)

2.37% Dividend. The last 3 years the dividend growth rate has been 68% ( I know this cant go on forever with the current growth rate but I believe it could maintain a steady dividend increase for years if not decades.) (Also assuming the merger doesn't go through and ACI stays solo.)

**Earnings is expected 4/9.**

&#x200B;

The earnings is one of the things I am most bullish on. The reason being after watching ACI get beaten with a bat on the YTD, I saw a little glimmer of hope this month. It seems that ACI does not feel comfortable being under 20.60 and is fighting to be 21 dollars. Every morning since the 5th of March someone has been beating the shit out of Albertsons or there is a sell off just for it to regain and be up on day. I think the bears are finally getting tired of the same bearish thing over and over again (The Merger). I think the tune is going to have to change next week or the week after with earnings coming up. Another reason I am bullish on earnings is Albertsons seems to usually beat earnings. It doesn't barley skim by beating earnings it usually beats the expected EPS by 10% sometimes upwards of 15-20%.  My prediction is that Albertsons is down a couple days this week maybe next week and then goes up all the way to earnings and then a couple days after.

For a company that seems to not be doing so well at the first glance in Robbingthehood there is a lot of good things that Albertsons is doing.

They seem to be adapting to digital quite well and grocery delivery/curbside. They have successfully partnered with **Instacart, Doordash and Uber**

**Third Quarter of Fiscal 2023 Highlights**

* Identical sales increased 2.9%
* Digital sales increased 21%
* Loyalty members increased 17% to 38.5 million
* Net income of $361 million, or $0.62 per share
* Adjusted net income of $462 million, or $0.79 per share
* Adjusted EBITDA of $1,107 million

&#x200B;

I think just in general this might be one of those long term buy and forget about it plays that the buffet guy likes to have.

**BUT**

Calls are cheaper than fuck right now for 4/19. I am probably going to load up tomorrow on 22 calls. (I say load up but I'm a broke bitch so I'll probably grab 30-50.)

Why Reddit IPO is actually a sure win long long play.," 

Long term It will 100% be profitable because of what they are actually becoming.

Thing is you and the rest of the ppl saying ""it sucks bla bla bla"" have 0 clue what reddit actually is doing and why this is a monster of an IPO.... but I kinda hope you actually don't buy in just yet. Yet... I will share the truth with you again one last time as WSB has been good to me.

Someone else posted "" I've been a redditor for 14 years. In that time, the only good idea I can think of that they've ever had was the innovative up/downvote mechanism for moderating UCC. That's. it. (Am I missing any?) Beyond that, everything good about reddit is because of the users and mods. ""

YES you are missing what reddit is actually doing and it's been a long long long play in the making.

I work in the website industry and right now SEO is king. Aka how do I get any website to show up as the top result out of 16,433,344 results for any keyword.

Now lets say... you lost a bet on [r/WSB](https://www.reddit.com/r/WSB/) and were forced to stick a cactus up your ass to save face. Well you did it posted to [r/wsb](https://www.reddit.com/r/wsb/) and avoided a ban.... Ppl make fun of you and all that .... but what now???? Are you going to go to the ER and explain what transpired?  
No ...

You are going to google ""how do I remove cactus thorns"" and there will be a few different types of websites linked... At the tippy top will be QUORA and REDDIT...  
and reddit will have a post like this "" [https://www.reddit.com/r/phoenix/comments/rk7m5a/how\_to\_get\_out\_those\_little\_cacti\_thorns\_from\_skin/](https://www.reddit.com/r/phoenix/comments/rk7m5a/how_to_get_out_those_little_cacti_thorns_from_skin/) ""

Now by reading said REDDIT post you learned Ellmers glue works great and REDDIT actually saves your ass!

Meanwhile in the future, reddit will be selling ads and your data. See reddit isn't actually a forum anymore and the long long long term play is to have a SEO website for any dam question someone could ask that is Google indexed. Thanks to us ... they have that.

Now could someone come behind them and do it too... Sure.. but they are 20 years behind the curve and lets face it won't catch up and beat them in SEO...",wallstreetbets,https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1be9s8p/why_reddit_ipo_is_actually_a_sure_win_long_long/,2024-03-13 22:01:27,0.10816326530612248,0.4118934240362811,0.067,0.161,0.9915

Bitcoin: Bull v. Bear,"Wud up fuckers.  I will try to keep this short because I understand most of you ADHD autistic regards have the attention span of a 3 year old.  I am going to lay out the bull and bear case for Bitcoin.

Bull Case:

Bitcoin has a 4 year cycle, centered around the halving event.  Here is a list of the low to high price after each halving. 

2012 Halving: $12.40

13 months later: $1,170

2016 Halving: $535

18 months later: $19,400

2020 Halving: $8,590

18 months later: $69,000

There are diminishing returns each cycle, so the first one was about 95x, second cycle was 35x and the third cycle was 8x.  As you can see, this next cycle should be around 2-3x from the price at the halving, but the halving isn't until next month and we are already at $73,000.  Let's just go with the current price, the peak should be $146,000 - $219,000 per Bitcoin around 18 months from now.

Bear Case:

BiTcOiN mUh fAkE mUuNeY, bItCoIn BaD, BiTcOiN StOoPiD.  I bUy ShInEy YeLlOw RoCk.

TL;DR:  Buy Bitcoin (not financial advice) before you miss out and FOMO in a year from now at $120,000 like the regarded ghey bear you are.

Why the MSTR Short Squeeze Happening Real Time,"Getting a lot of regarded posts about ""MSTR PREMIUM TOO HIGH"" or ""BUY BTC ETF INSTEAD"". To the uninformed regards here, this is why MSTR is $1800 now and is likely heading to $3500+ even without the price of Bitcoin moving. 

1. **MSTR is heavily shorted**

\- [https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/mstr](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/mstr) \- % of Float Shorted is 19.26% which is roughly tesla levels back in 2020-2021.

2. **Stock price unexpectedly ballooned due to Bitcoin price rising + incoming halving**

\- Given how over 20% of their float was shorted, the rapid price rise + investor demand triggered a squeeze from short sellers needing to buy back over $6B worth of shares to cover their position.

**3.  Why stock price went up 10%+ today**

\- Only around 1/20th of the short positions were covered ($300M), and even that amount triggered a large increase in MSTR price. This is despite Bitcoin not even increasing in price today.

This means a squeeze is literally happening right now. MSTR went up over 10%+ today without Bitcoin prices even moving.

**4.  Bitcoin will continue to increase in price from MSTR taking loans + Halving**

\-  MSTR just took out another $500M loan today to buy Bitcoin. This just exacerbates the price of Bitcoin, which increases MSTR's stock price. The result of this is short sellers having to pay much higher prices + puts higher pressure on them to cover their positions.

**5.  Short Sellers Need to buy back $6B+ worth of Shares**

\- The result of all the short sellers covering their position might mean  MSTR goes up over $3500+ without BTC price increasing much. On top of that, there's an upward pressure due to Bitcoin's halving coming soon.

$GETY: Tomorrow's Earnings Will Be a Bloodbath 📉 🚀,"Let's dive deep into the dumpster fire that is $GETY, better known as Getty Images. Tomorrow, they're dropping their earnings report.

First off, let's talk about the elephant in the room: AI. Companies ain't shelling out big bucks for stock photos when they can whip up their own images with AI-generated images for a fraction of the cost.

But don't just take my word for it, let's crunch some numbers. Getty's revenue has been on a steady decline, and with the rise of AI-driven content creation tools, the future is not looking too bright for these photo peddlers.

## Expect mixed results and pain to continue

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zxyqu1yta6oc1.png?width=612&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d9891bf0a30f63719d2036da0de354114478ab1

Before we get into what to expect for the final quarter of the 2023 fiscal year, it might be helpful to touch on the financial results reported by the company as of late. This would involve data through the [third quarter of 2023](https://www.sec.gov/ixviewer/ix.html?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1898496/000162828023038961/gety-20230930.htm#i7ed374fb096a43b2bc001fcaa9742b4a_82). For that time, revenue came in at $229.3 million. That's down only modestly from the $230.5 million generated the same time one year earlier. Working in the company's favor was the fact that total active annual subscribers stood at 202,000 at the end of that quarter. That was nearly double the 107,000 that the business had one year earlier. Management attributed this growth to expansion in its ecommerce subscriptions, including but not limited to iStock and Unsplash+.

https://preview.redd.it/bv1bpul4b6oc1.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ee60d8c13f1d41b3611f930c3582a0586c52034

And let's not forget about the competition.. From Shutterstock to Adobe Stock, there's no shortage of alternatives offering similar services at more competitive prices.

But where things turned bad was when we started talking about the total purchasing customers. This dropped from 837,000 to 826,000 in the course of a single year. This metric represents the total customers who made a purchase from the company within the trailing 12 months. Management attributed this to a shift in customers into annual subscription products. All the decline here showed up in the Editorial portion of the company, with revenue on a reported basis dropping 2.3% and being down 3.3% on a constant currency basis.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/91pf7v3cb6oc1.png?width=604&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa7fae10fcb76a428193429753da7489c111eba8

Even though revenue fell, the bottom line for the enterprise did improve. It went from negative $149.4 million for net profits to negative $18.4 million. Other profitability metrics were rather mixed. Operating cash flow, for instance, fell from $48.9 million to $25.2 million. Even if we adjust for changes in working capital, we get a decline from $55.8 million to $4.4 million. On the other hand, EBITDA for the company managed to inch up slightly from $77.7 million to $80.3 million. In the chart above, you can see these mixed results, with revenue falling but profits and cash flows coming in all over the map, for the first nine months of 2023 relative to the same time of 2022.

&#x200B;

Tomorrow's earnings report will be a bloodbath.

NVDA h100s use as much power as a house,"Ok guys DD for the next few months, AI GPUs use as much energy as a house, and nvdia h100s in use Are the equivalent to 2,000,000 houses being added to the energy grid. With this year also being el Niño we are expecting warmer than usual temperatures. A combination of increased demand from all spectrums will constrain an already limited power grid.  

The Answer? Well nuclear is the winner but its not here yet in bulk across the country and many plants are being phased out. Coal is too harmful for environmentalists. ""Eco friendly"" solar and wind dont produce enough on their own and that leaves two options. OIL, and Nat Gas. Oil will hit 90$ a barrel this summer and nat gas is a few points off all time lows.  

The result? On a calorie basis Nat gas is 6 times cheaper to use than oil to power the grid.

DICKS (DKS) Earnings Tomorrow,"I pitched this stock on Sunday up 4% since. 

Earnings Tomorrow. Here’s why she might fly. 🦅 (Check Sunday DD for a deeper Dive)

1. Based on other retailers, WSM, Abercrombie I’m expecting an earnings beat with Revenue and Net Income Growth. (Competitors have had revenue declines). Also expecting good guidance as inflation pressures have cooled and the consumer has held up nicely. 

2. Big Dividend increase, last year they increased it 100% I wouldn’t be surprised to see a 50%+ increase. 

3. Still selling at a good price. Around 14.4 PE while the S&P is at 23.3. 

I estimated Dicks to be around 13.00 EPS based on 80 Million shares and 1.04B net income. Divided 188 by 13 and get the 14.4 PE.

4. Speculating a Stock Split. Last time they split the stock was 2007 at 67$ a share its trading at 188$ rn.

My PT is $420.69

Take 13$ EPS and multiply that by a PE ratio of 32.6077. 30% of the time it works every time. 

Overall:

I love the Business and like the Stock.

Meanwhile, their ad server sucks, their search is awful, their mobile app sucks, their web site requires a third-party plugin to not suck... and so on.

Case for a Peloton rebound ,"tldr -- Since pre-covid, Peloton has grown its subscription business -- which is similar to a streaming subscription -- from $77.1M in Q4 2019 to $424.5M in Q4 2023. While product sales (ie of its bikes and treadmills) have declined significantly since Q4 2021 during COVID, subscription revenue continues to grow and expand margins. Peloton is heavily undervalued, trading at ~1x its subscription revenue.

Two revenue streams:
Peloton sells ""Connected Fitness Products"" and ""Subscription"". The devices it sells can only work with its subscription services.

Peloton's subscription revenue:
* Q4 2023 -- $424.5M with $139M in costs (67.3% gross margin)
* Q4 2020 -- $194.7M with $77.2M in costs (60.3% gross margin)
* Q4 2019 -- $77.1M with $32.4M in costs (58% gross margin)

I chose Q4 2019 because it's the last fiscal quarter before COVID lockdowns and Q4 2020 as this was roughly the peak of its COVID boom years. Q4 in each year, to account for seasonality.

Meanwhile, it's Connected Fitness Products revenue:
* Q4 2023 -- $319.1M with $305.3M in costs (4.3% gross margin)
* Q4 2020 -- $870.1M with $562.8M in costs (35.3% gross margin)
* Q4 2019 -- $389.1M with $236.7 in costs (39.2% gross margin)

The business of selling bikes and treadmills has gotten significantly worse, due to a glut of inventory, declining demand as people return to in-person gyms, and increased costs from suppliers.

However, every bike that it has sold during COVID is still circulating around the real world. If someone no longer wants to use their Peloton, they'll cancel their subscription and sell their bike...and the next person will sign up for a subscription. The depreciation of these products in the secondary market is irrelevant to Peloton. As long the units remain in service, each one represents a guaranteed subscription.

While the products business isn't doing as well, I would expect that over time, their cost increases and inventory issues will abate.

But the only business that really matters is the subscription business, which is structurally similar to a streaming service like Netflix -- there is a fixed cost of content creation, and a near zero marginal cost for additional subscribers. That is why Peloton's gross margin on its subscription business has expanded by 16% (67.3%/58%) as it increases its subscriber base.

Speaking of Netflix, as of 3/12/2024, its market capitalization is ~$264B. Based on its Q3 2023 10-Q, it's around a $34.2B annual revenue run rate, on $19.72B in cost of revenue (42.3% gross margin).

So Netflix's streaming revenue has a meaningfully worse gross margin than Peloton's streaming (subscription) revenue, yet it trades for ~7.72x revenue. I would assume that Peloton's subscription revenue is higher quality, with higher retention rates, as it's much easier to cut a Netflix subscription.

Why is that? Well... Netflix generates a net profit whereas Peloton doesn't. Netflix spends ~5.6% of its revenue on G&A, whereas Peloton stands at ~21.6%. There's a lot of fat yet to cut, which my hope is that the updated management team focuses on.

But I believe the market is undervaluing Peloton due to its declining topline revenue. This is simply the wrong way to look at it. The real business is the subscription side, which makes traditional SaaS-esque gross margins and is sticky, as it's built into each device they ship.

The company has a dedicated user base with ~1% monthly churn. That’s quite good for a subscription business.

You can think of each device that Peloton sells as the cost of customer acquisition for the high-margin subscription business. If Peloton can generate meaningful gross profits from selling devices, then great. But if you think about devices as a cost of acquisition, then it's not actually important for the products to be profitable. In fact, selling devices at-cost would be a logical strategy.

Peloton also has a ~$700M term loan -- that it took out which currently charges a 14.5% APR. This is too high, but over time as interest rates come down, it should be able to refinance that rate down -- https://finance.yahoo.com/news/citigroup-sounds-private-credit-firms-004509215.html?g[…]bAyxCaYPDATfhE2Ki_FtqPiL8sTXM36sdJLB1RJyHRW7guTiC7ksj_ovBOXh

It also raised $1B in convertible senior notes in early 2021...at a 0% interest rate! The notes are due on Feb 11, 2026 and can be converted into stock at $239.23/share or repaid. It's most likely that few note holders will convert into stock at that price, which means Peloton was effectively able to borrow $1B with zero interest. However, it'll likely need to refinance this, as it's unlikely to be able to fully repay the notes by the time they come due.

The biggest risk is that Peloton carries ~$1.68B in debt. It'll need to cut down on sales, marketing, and G&A expenses to be able to return to financial health. In the meantime, I expect the profitability profile of the company to improve, for it to be able to refinance its debt, and contend that its subscription business is being undervalued as it continues to grow and expand margin.",wallstreetbets,https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bdxsze/case_for_a_peloton_rebound/,2024-03-13 13:49:09,0.025656565656565652,0.4118253968253968,0.079,0.086,0.9049

Will Splunk Have a Bright Future?,"The first good (as I see it) news is that Cisco revealed a significant move with a $28 billion all-cash deal to acquire Splunk (btw making it Cisco's biggest acquisition to date).

Moreover, as you may remember, Splunk had scandal due to they continuously told investors that they are investing in marketing, hiring sales professionals, and soon will be profitable. And by August 2020 Splunk stock reached its peak of $200 per share.

Later, in December 2020, the company admitted that they actually “suspended investments in marketing” and “froze hiring“. As a result, Splunk suffered a hard miss in its third-quarter financial results. And finally, after three years, the situation has been resolved, and Splunk is now paying a [settlement](https://11thestate.com/cases/splunk-shareholder-settlement) of $30M.

As far as I remember, they were always messed in smth and had to deal with lots of scandals constantly.

Unfortunately we won't know that we hit peak solar activity until 7 months after it happens and a lot of scientists are saying it won't be as bad as some claim, but look, the more people learn about solar storms these next few years, the more people will prep, so there's gotta be a shred of value in this catastrophe to squeeze out.

"PATH, S, DKS, & DG earnings today, turn on the BRRRRRR","Good morning from Europooristan.

Big fucking day today, earnings season is boring AF rn, but I've got 4 (!!!!) stocks that I'll be gambling on today: UiPath (reports today), SentinelOne (reports today), DICK'S Sporting Goods (reports tmrw), and Dollar General (reports tmrw).

*Disclaimer: I do not intend to engage in political discourse in this post; the opinions expressed below are solely derived from various experiences in my life.*

&#x200B;

1. **PATH** \- I thought this was your average Silicon Valley software company, turns out these fellas are from Romania! My chad of a godfather is from Romania, I haven’t seen him in 10 years since he went to prison, but I respect him deeply. This company has beaten expectations every quarter last year, not tryna be tin foil racist in here, but from my experience, Romanians value family above everything, so they will do ANYTHING to provide for them. These guys know how to perform, and I haven’t seen Hindenburg post a hit piece on them yet, so until that time comes, I'm bullish tonight.
2. **S** \- You might know my stance on software companies by now, but this company is different. Why? Because SentinelOne is run by Jews (looking at the 3 founders' last names). And for whatever reason, Jews just have that Midas touch. These guys know how to do business. Also, this is a cybersecurity company, unlike the other software companies that went tits up after earnings. This is basically Crowdstrike’s little brother, so I will go long on this stock tonight. And no, Mossad has not pressured me to say this after I shorted ZIM yesterday.
3. **DKS** \- First I want to express that I am not homophobic, because when I was in the 3rd grade, I thought that I was gay, cuz I could draw, my uncle was, and I kept my room straight, I told my mom tear rushing down my face she like ben you loved girls since before pre-K trippin. well I guess she had a point didnt she? But on a serious note, how can anyone buy calls on a company called ‘Dicks’. Stonk is up 50% since last earnings, how can anyone justify the price on this?? I just looked at their website using a VPN since they blocked europoors accessing their site (wtf??) Why are their products so overpriced? I can buy Patagonia for the same price….. Expect red dildos.
4. **DG** \- These guys are literally the bottom of the barrel for retail, their stores look like the avg gas station in south Chicago. Why do people even shop at these places? Why would you buy a 10oz bottle of laundry detergent, just go to Walmart bro….. Dollar Tree just reported, and they shit the bed, so I'm bearish coming into earnings with this one.

Gogoro Status Update,"All EV companies have been under pressure lately. It's time to take a look at Gogoro, a company providing battery swapping services for two wheelers in APAC region.

The company made two particularly interesting product launches recently. Gogoro Pulse is the flagship product with best in class features and Gogoro JEGO a low priced mass market product. Now it seems that those units are generating excellent sales.

New product launches:   
\- Gogoro Pulse was launched at the end of January. It's hands down the best EV scooter in the market. Over 1,000 pre-orders in one month.  
\- Gogoro JEGO. Affordable mass market scooter targeted for early majority. Over 1,500 units ordered after the launch two weeks ago.

Gogoro has two main strategic goals:  
1. Increase EV adoption in Taiwan (currently 9%) in B2B and B2B segments.  
2. International expansion especially in India in B2B segment.

  
TAIWAN

Gogoro Statistics:  
\- Close to 600,000 subscribers.  
\- More than 12,000 battery swapping stations and 1.3 million Gogoro smart batteries deployed across Taiwan. Taiwan EV market share is 9% of which 85% are powered by Gogoro batteries. Government has aggressive target to increase EV adoption.  
\- International expansion is focused in India, Philippines and South Korea.  
\- Scooter sales decreased slightly last year while the battery swapping network expanded further.  


&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/tee3z9vlm3oc1.png?width=488&format=png&auto=webp&s=0bff6bb17decdd304cfee7224e51132a03c2cde4

INDIA

\- One B2B product launched so far (CrossOver) and first orders received from B2B partners.  
\- Local scooter manufacturing up and running.  
\- Battery manufacturing starting in Q2.  
\- Battery swapping network about to expand to 100+ stations by mid 2024.  
\- Government has indicated that they will heavily support charging ecosystem in the future.  


Gogoro has used extensive amount of time to build an organization in India and getting prepared for expansion. Main capex partner at the moment is the state of Maharashtra which has helped Gogoro with setting up local manufacturing facilities. A local gas station company is also a partner providing thousands of battery swapping locations.

  
OTHER COUNTRIES

\- South Korea: about 200 battery swapping stations in 18 cities.  
\- The Philippines: things getting started in Metro Manila.  
\- Piloting action also in China, Israel, Indonesia, Singapore, Japan, Colombia and Chile.

  
SHARE PRICE

\- Following global EV trend (downward).  
\- SPAC listing price $10 and now at $1.30 (12th of March).

  
GOOD TO KNOW

\- Best battery swapping product/services in the market.  
\- Company has  $173.9 million cash balance and they are controlling costs efficiently.  
\- They have invested $650-$700 million to Taiwan's battery swapping network.  
\- Sticky and growing subscriber base generating significant amount revenue.

  
It remains to be seen if they will succeed in mass adoption in Taiwan and if they are able to execute successful international expansion but at least sustainability megatrend is support them. Based on the stock market volume this is a forgotten company at the moment and big moves can be expected if more interest arise. Naturally the main focus will remain in their performance.

Adobe Earnings: The Shovel supplier for Gen AI,"Tldr: Adobe calls 3/15 strike whatever



Why Adobe?



People are hyping up gen AI, but leave that alone for a minute.

Adobe has a partnership for AI with Microsoft and Nvidia since 2010 for their business intelligence unit that noone knows about, except their customers and accountants, because this thing is printing cash.

They also have a software suit that all professional media designers use with no exception, and they throw in pdf stuff to be as integrated as Microsoft in the world of business processes.

DocuSigns whole market model is just a tiny sidegig for them and they use free document signing to get people into their ecosystem.

Now to GenAI: Have you talked with people who actually use this? AI is great to create images from a prompt, but there is always editing work involved afterwards to fix the details.

Adobe is selling the tools to edit AI pics.

Opinion / Food-for-Thought,"Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) often spark intense debate within the blockchain community, with some championing complete decentralization while others emphasize the practicalities of mainstream adoption.

&#x200B;

In envisioning a future where digital currencies reign supreme, CBDCs present an intriguing proposition. Imagine a world where cumbersome paperwork for financial transactions becomes a relic of the past, replaced by seamless digital identities verified by government-backed entities.

&#x200B;

As we journey towards a cashless society, the integration of CBDCs opens doors to unprecedented efficiency and accessibility. Embracing this evolution isn't about compromising decentralization—it's about striking a harmonious balance between innovation and regulation to foster widespread adoption.

McRibonomics: How McDonald's McRib and Bitcoin Are Set to Trigger the $100M Super Cycle,"7 Months ago i called out the [Bitcoin bull run and its correlation to McDonalds Fish Fillet](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/165x0f0/why_the_next_bull_run_will_be_kickstarted_by/) And now I am pleased to announce another absolutely massive indicator

In a tantalizing tale of culinary and financial innovation, the McRib, a cult classic born in 1981, emerges as a pivotal player in the saga of Bitcoin's meteoric rise to $100 million.

Crafted by McDonald's inaugural Executive Chef René Arend, the McRib burst onto the scene as a limited-time sensation, captivating taste buds around Kansas City before conquering the nation. This savory marvel, alongside its poultry predecessor, the Chicken McNuggets, cemented Arend's legacy as a culinary visionary.

But what does a saucy, rib-shaped sandwich have to do with the digital gold rush of Bitcoin? Enter the concept of McRibonomics, where the evolution of fast food mirrors the disruptive force of cryptocurrency.

Just as the McRib tantalized palates with its limited availability, Bitcoin sparked intrigue as a decentralized alternative to traditional currencies. Both phenomena captured the public's imagination, ushering in eras of excitement and speculation.

Fast forward to the present, where Bitcoin has soared to dizzying heights, recently touching $70,000 and beyond. Yet, the McRib's return to McDonald's menus remains a periodic delight, showcasing the power of nostalgia and demand-driven economics.

Now, imagine a world where the McRib's cyclical comebacks align with Bitcoin's market cycles, fueling a super cycle that propels BTC to an astounding $100 million per coin. A whimsical notion? Perhaps. But in the realm of McRibonomics, where culinary cravings intersect with digital dreams, anything is possible.

So, as you savor the tangy goodness of a McRib, dare to dream of a future where its fleeting appearances coincide with Bitcoin's bullish surges, culminating in a financial feast fit for the history books.

I hope this helps you. I'm also here to answer any questions. 

The TL;DR is that it's not a scam and the yield is legitimate (coming from the funding rate of perpetual shorts and native ETH yield. But you should really understand what's going on behind the scenes because this is not your normal stable coin and there are additional risks to consider.

My way of approximating the potential high of a coin or token.,"Once you figure out which coins or tokens that you want to own, and I am sure you have several, you then need to figure out which coins or tokens you need to allocate most of your money.

As an example, we can see that Filecoin hit an all time high of $237 USD back in April 2021.  At the current price of $8.85, you may think that it can go up 26.8 times.  But in the near future, it will not.  All these coins and tokens have much more in circulation than they did during the last bull run, and so if Filecoin went up 26.8 times now then it will have a marketcap of $125 billion which is way more than the marketcap of Tether (USDT) which is the #3 coin in marketcap ranking.

What I do is look at the marketcaps of the top 10 coins/tokens and figure out how many times more my coins or tokens need to go up by in order to reach the same marketcap.  For example, if Avalanche has a marketcap of $20.724 billion and it is in #10 spot then Filecoin with a marketcap of $4.652 billion, needs to go up by (20.724 divided by 4.652) 4.4549 time.  In other words, at current price of $8.85, it needs to go up to (8.85 x 4.4549) $39.43  Is this possible?  Sure.  Do not look at the all time high of $237 and expect Filecoin to get there again.  But it can get to $39.43.  So if you invest $1000 into Filecoin, it may go to $4455, if it makes it to the top ten at current prices.

Of course this is not exact science and of course even the top 10 coins and tokens will also go up in value and so will their marketcaps.  But it will give you an idea of how to divide up your investments.  This is how I allocate my money as I buy $100 worth every so often to dollar-cost-average.  A good example of one  of my top coins is Graph.  I allocated most of my money into this because I figured at that time, it had the most upside potential, and I am already up 3 times.

Good luck to you all.  Thanks for reading.",CryptoCurrency,https://reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1bm0uzj/my_way_of_approximating_the_potential_high_of_a/,2024-03-23 15:40:04,0.26970588235294113,0.45292483660130717,0.0,0.092,0.9858

I had $20K stolen after approving transactions on a fraudulent website,"So, I messed up... I always tried to be super careful and verify links and everything, but I got in a rush and didn't pay enough attention.

The Coinbase Base page on X made a post about an NFT, so I went to the link and minted it.

Then the first reply under that post had another link, and the profile was made to look exactly like the Base page, and I clicked that link, connected my wallet, and approved a couple of transactions.

Immediately I came to my senses and realized the page looked off, and in a blink of an eye, $10,000 in USDC on Base and $10,000 in USDC on Avalanche left my wallet. I couldn't believe that I messed up so bad. Usually I'm incredibly careful, and I know that the majority of posts on X are scams, but I rushed too much. I feel so dumb.

Has anyone had this happen? Did you report it?

I decided to report it to the SEC, CFTC, FTC, and FBI. I wasn't going to because I messed up, but I figured I might as well, but nothing will probably come from it.

I looked up the WHOIS for the website, and it lists a name and the state of MN, but I assume that's bogus information. But who knows?

Any advice?

I assume there's not much I can do besides being more careful in the future and slowing down.

Crypto and Web 3 will never be mainstream,"Yes the title is a bit provocative but as the years go by I think is as evident as ever that crypto in the sense of having your cold or hot wallet (especially cold wallets) will never be mainstream, even cex that are way more user friendly like binance (from my experience the most user friendly) will be used way more in comparison but not by the normal person, I think It would be used only as backend or as something like ETF,  they defeat the purpose of decentralization but there's nothing we can do.
The only example that comes to mind is something similar to gold, it's very unusual for normal people to use it or buy it physically and keeping it in they're safe at home but it's still used behind the scene, buying something that represents it online or inside normal object.

Revolutionize Your Crypto Strategy with Kollit: Where Market Insight Meets Game Theory!,"Hi all!

I am very happy to launch today my new tool called Kollit!

[kollit.streamlit.app](https://kollit.streamlit.app)

It's a tool i've been working on for some time now and been using it myself.

I'm a Master’s student in Computer Science, focusing on AI and statistics at one of the top universities in europe. I have been in the crypto space for the last 5ish years and I decided i wanted to study computer science because of crypto! This background inspired me to create **Kollit**, a new groundbreaking tool designed to redefine how we approach crypto exit / entry strategies.

### The Birth of Kollit: Navigating the Waters of Regret

At the heart of Kollit is the concept of managing trading regret, an approach that is not entirely explored in this field. 

* **Regret of Action:** The sinking feeling when you realize you sold or bought too early.
* **Regret of Inaction:** The missed opportunities because you hesitated to make a move.

Kollit introduces a groundbreaking way to balance these regrets using your market expectations. Here’s how:

* By analyzing your personalized market outlook, Kollit identifies  optimal points for buying or selling that align with your risk tolerance  and market predictions.
* My algorithm then mathematically balances the **regret of action** with the **regret of inaction**, tailoring a strategy that not only fits your market view but also your personal trading style.

I use market simulations based on your predictions to explore a few scenarios given your market expectations and risk tolerance to find the best fitting strategy. 

### A Work in Progress: Kollit’s Journey

Kollit is my baby, currently in its first stage but it will keep evolving. It's 100% free but not 100% free of bugs and glitchs. Bear with it and you will get the exit plan you always needed!

L2s are against crypto's core ideology of decentralization and still people praising it,"We all can agree that high gas fee isn't good. This is probably the the main reason why L2s come in play.

But L2s are so centralized. Coinbase's BASE L2 is run by just a couple servers...same goes for Arbitrum, Optimish, Starknet, Linea...

Crypto's core ideology is decentralization, what sense does it make to have one decent decentralized L1 on which dozens of very centralized L2s operating on top of it?!

If the L2 fail, your L1 coins are gone! Your L2 coins are just a mirror of the real L1 coins.

Not your keys, not your coins...this is the saying when it comes to CEXes VS self-custodial wallets, but in terms of L1 and L2s the same goes, too. If you ""own"" your coins on a L2, this doesn't 100% represent your coins. As long as the L2 functions, you're fine. If they fail, you can kiss your coins goodbye!

As this isn't crypto perversion enough, there are new upcoming L2s that uses EVM + SVM + Data availbility on another blockchain (I won't call out the names).

If just 1 of the underlying mechanics fail, you either lose your coins or a ""backup""-functions kicks in which turns gas fee as high as on mainnet.

Did I avoid being hacked/scammed?,"TL;DR at the bottom

So, I was scrolling through twitter yesterday checking some tweets about an airdrop I am participating in, and below one of the main accounts tweets, was another tweet (impersonating the main one) mentioning something about a vote, and me, thinking this was legit, went ahead and wanted to partake in said vote. 

I went to the website, and connected to the website with metamask. Metamask didn't show any sign of problems connecting but the website did, so I tried for about 3 times, disconnecting from metamask and connecting again, and around the third time was when it hit me: ""This site isn't official, must be a scam"", so I went to check the tweet and yes, it was a fake one, and my heart sank like never before hahah so I quickly disconnected and started to check if everything was alright. I didn't get to sign any transaction or any allowances for tokens or anything, just connected to the website. 

I immediately thought that someone most probably must have drained my account and made a transfer, but I then checked etherscan and nothing. It's been more than 20 hours and I haven't seen any transactions in any block explorer, nor do I have any token allowances, everything is intact, so far. Did I really dodged being scammed? Did it save me by not signing any transactions? Am I still at risk by having connected to the website but not doing anything? Ive been trying to check if there's anything to revoke, but can't find anything in particular, nor if there is a history of the websites that I have connected with metamask. Is there anything specific I should do? Any advice is much appreciated :)

Choose the date you want to sell instead,"I read about so many people choosing when to buy and sell this year or the next, taking profits, etc.  I’ve experienced both sides of the coin(pun intended).

Luckily I managed to DCA to own a full coin again, but it let me realize that even if you “win” and take your profit you may still not be happy.

Ethereum Supply Crunch,"Hello!

It's widely acknowledged that Bitcoin's halving event plays a significant role in its price appreciation. Despite an inflation rate of approximately 2% (from what I recall), Bitcoin's price has demonstrated a robust upward trajectory over time.

Could it be that the situation with Ethereum introduces a similar, even stronger dynamic? Currently, Ethereum is experiencing a negative inflation rate due to the ongoing burning of ETH. This process has been in effect for several months already.

However, I hardly read anyone mention this anymore. Given these circumstances, one might wonder if Ethereum is poised for a similar (and unexpected) price pressure?

Institutional investors will be eyeing Litecoin,"In my opinion, institutional investors will be eyeing Litecoin in the near term. Currently, all eyes are on bitcoin in the world of institutional investing, but as its market cap continues to rise, investors will begin to look for comparable coins. 

When they are looking for comparable coins they will have a few things on their checklist : proof of work, hard cap, security, decentralization. This will be the criteria, not only because bitcoin checks all these boxes, but because these items also make for the perfect investment vehicle / store of value. If Bitcoin is digital gold, then Litecoin is digital silver. Investors are realizing this fast.

Institutional investors are becoming more and more wary of coins like Ethereum and Solana because they are concerned that the SEC will label them unregistered securities. They do not have that fear when it comes to Litecoin, because its framework is so similar to Bitcoin, which has been declared a commodity. 

I believe this cycle is all about institutional adoption, and Litecoin is a well oiled machined, right next to bitcoin, waiting to be scooped up for a fraction of the price.

Why should there be an Altcoin-Season again?," 

Hi,

People argue that after a significant Bitcoin rally, an altcoin season always follows. This pattern is expected to recur.

I understand this argument based on historical data points: Investments in Bitcoin can easily be redirected to altcoins since funds, whether in the form of stablecoins or Bitcoin itself, can be smoothly converted into altcoins through centralized exchanges (CEXes) and decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms.

However, a question arises about the billions of dollars currently flowing into Bitcoin: what becomes of them? I presume these Bitcoins are secured in ETF wallets, and it appears that the USD to buy ETFs is kept outside of the cryptocurrency sphere.

So, what is the rationale behind the pro-altcoin season viewpoint?",CryptoCurrency,https://reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1blpeyy/why_should_there_be_an_altcoinseason_again/,2024-03-23 06:51:58,0.08854166666666667,0.4697916666666666,0.042,0.059,0.2881

"If you invest, you need to lose first","Despite we common narrative that crypto only goes up, it goes up and down.

If anyone comes into the crypto space to have only profits going up, you're entering this space with a wrong mindset.

Not only in crypto, but for investments in general, you need to learn to ""lose"".

if we're still in a bullmarket

if you're still holding your winning coins without selling at a loss earlier...

EVEN a real bot, not just someone trying to get you to send coins to their account (like the ones I'm talking about) are a fraud.  They are gonna countertrade the bot and make bank if they get even a little following

YouTube is the enemy

Now if you download a legitimate bot and have your own strategy (not someone else's), you could possibly make money..... but the odds are still against you ",CryptoCurrency,https://reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1bljkog/why_is_youtube_allowing_scam_videos_bots_are_a/,2024-03-23 00:24:17,0.15208333333333335,0.55,0.107,0.0,0.0

Best affordable dead man switch service for giving crypto to relatives after death?,"Hello. For anyone unaware, a dead man switch is a switch that executes a task if you don't check in within X time. For example, send this email to person A if I don't login within 3 months.

I would like to send information on how to access my crypto wallets / where to find them, to my loved ones after I die. The platform would send my relatives my instructions if I didn't login in time (because I died).

Does anyone know a good and affordable death man switch service? Or a reputable platform that has a death man switch or emergency access that works similarly as one of the options?

"The State of the Web3 User and Developer Experience in four leading Web3 platforms: Ethereum, Solana, Aptos, and Radix. - A report by CryptoEQ","# Who is CryptoEQ?

[https://www.cryptoeq.io](https://www.cryptoeq.io)

From their website:

>CryptoEQ™ is an independent cryptocurrency analysis and rating agency  that provides unbiased, objective, and transparent research you can  trust. We help people navigate their investment journey and trading  decisions. 

&#x200B;

# TL;DR:

The report compares the UX and DX across these 4 platforms by focusing on how tokens, accounts, smart contracts, and transactions within the respective virtual machines. Radix is the most secure followed by Aptos. Eth and Solana have bigger dev community.

**User Experience (UX)**

Ethereum and Solana face UX challenges like complex token behaviors, blind signing transactions, and wallet security risks. Aptos and Radix introduce improvements like predictable token standards and  human-readable transactions.

**Tokens, Accounts & NFTs**

Assets on Ethereum and Solana are based on token smart contracts, which can bring uncertainty, and smart contract risk, token's behavior is opaque. Assets on Aptos and Radix are “objects”, while on Radix these are native to the platform, offering greater transparency and security, malicious tokens are impossible.

**Transactions**

Transactions on Ethereum and Solana are “blind signed”, which results in frequent users losing funds to wallet drains or other scams. Radix's Transaction Manifest enables human-readable transactions, multiple atomic smart contract calls and user-set guarantees, improving composability and security.

**Developer Experience (DX)**

Aptos' Move language and Radix's Scrypto offer asset-oriented programming models, native features, and better security to simplify development compared to Solidity on Ethereum plus Radix's native asset-oriented tooling accelerates secure dApp development. Eth and Solana, on the other hand, have a more robust developer community and thus more libraries

Bitcoin in a Roth IRA (US); a way to catch up or actually retire later in life,"This is just a PSA, advice on finances, not professional help, for anyone who doesn't understand how powerful a Roth IRA is with Bitcoin.

Let me briefly explain how this financial tool is top tier for anyone who doesn't understand any type of 101 on Roth IRAs. You can make a lot of money through a Roth IRA and therefore the government has put a lot of restrictions on this tool. 

A Roth IRA is a financial account you can contribute to over the course of a year up to a specific limit, which is $7000 for anyone under 50, and up to $8000 for people over 50 as of 2024. 

There is also a limit on your income. If you make over $161,000 as a single filer, or over $228,000 if you file jointly with a spouse. If you are over these income amounts then you cannot contribute directly to a Roth IRA. 

Lastly, your contributions to a Roth IRA cannot be more than your earned income. Meaning having some sort of income at some point during the year is necessary.

What are the time limits on a Roth IRA? 5 years after initial contribution or 59 1/2. Any withdrawals before that have penalties, AKA essentially taxes. 

So why put $7000 into a Roth IRA to only withdraw much later in life? Because you, generally, are paying taxes on the money put into the account and DO NOT pay taxes on the profits when you withdraw past the time limits. 

Example: you contribute $5k a year, for 10 years, to a Roth IRA, bringing the total to $50k contributions. You leave it there growing until you turn 59 1/2 and during that time it 10x to $500k. You can withdraw those gains without paying taxes on those gains, legally. No worrying about the IRS hunting you down years and years later, or being audited and having to do a bunch of maneuvers to avoids fines or jail time. 

Why you would do this comes down to a simple question: do you believe you'll be paying more taxes now, or more taxes later in life? I foresee most governments taxing their citizens more and more over the decades, USA included. So pay the taxes now, not later. Make those gains tax-free. 

Currently you can open Roth IRAs with actual Bitcoin and crypto, or with Bitcoin ETFs, or with Bitcoin adjacent companies like Cleanspark, Riot, or Microstrategy. Bitcoin is averaging, over time, gains of roughly 140% per year, and is likely to continue massive gains for years and years to come. In 10-40 years it is possible Bitcoin could be worth magnitudes higher than now and if you had gains in a Roth IRA you would legally be able to obtain those gains with no tax penalty. 

Could things change years from now? Possibly, unfortunately. But the government is not likely to change the Roth IRA too drastically any time soon, or be able to change it completely all at once. 

If I made any mistakes or mistyped something please correct me. For those who see this and think ""that does sound good"" ... yes, yes it is. This is a long-term financial tool, not a 'make money quick' tool. Use it as intended and maybe 10, 20 years from now you'll be able to appreciate how much is sitting in your Roth IRA and be thankful you have a nest egg for later in life/when you retire. 

Lastly, there are a few small details that you should always explore when investing, for example, you can buy the ETFs on Fidelity but not Vanguard, or you would want to setup a Roth IRA where you DO have control of the investments which is the bulk of them but some financial institutions take control, etc....

"Seeking Recommendations for Crypto YouTube Channels Focused on Fundamental Analysis and Swing Trading
","
Hello everyone,

I'm not particularly interested in day trading or channels that primarily promote specific tokens or coins. Instead, I'm looking for content creators who delve into the fundamentals of alts or provide a quantitative approach into investing in some alts, providing insights into the technology behind them, market trends, socail trends and trading strategies that are more aligned with swing trading.

The reason I'm asking for YouTube channel recommendations specifically is that I find it very convenient to listen to these discussions while I'm walking or just relaxing. It's a way for me to stay informed and learn more about the crypto space without having to dedicate time exclusively for reading or screen time.

Here's what I'm ideally looking for in a YouTube channel:
- Focus on educational content over hype and speculation.
- Discussions on technological advancements and the fundamentals driving the value of different cryptocurrencies.
- Analysis of how global events and market trends could impact the crypto market.
- Insightful strategies for swing trading, including chart reading, market signals interpretation, and effective risk management.

If you have any personal favorites or know of channels that meet these criteria, please share them with me. I believe that having a solid understanding of the fundamentals and market dynamics is crucial for making informed trading decisions, and I'm eager to learn from reliable sources.

Hypothetical: The halving happens and Bitcoin goes up violently because of the plethora of perfect storm bullish catalysts for the rest of the year and forever. What do you do?,"This is just a hypothetical scenario, but let's think about it for a minute. Many sidelined people expect everything to go down massively due to inflation, war, credit card debt etc. But what if against their predictions, everything just stays sideways for a while, then goes up and stays up for months, years, CENTURIES?

You may say that's unrealistic, but I have given up on trying to predict the crypto market because it always goes up anyway. So just in case this happens, what would you do? When is the point where you would finally buy? Would you still keep trying to short?

QR coin update. BTC considering BIP proposals to be ready like Vitalik?,"Some very good conversations going on around what approach to take with upgrading for QR (Quantum Resistance).  Most of this got a lot of attention after Apple revealed their QR solution, along with Vitalik referring to a potential emergency plan if it became necessary.  


The discussion often turns to ""when"" changes need to be implemented, and some of that will depend on what user action is required.  From the conversation below, it looks like the currently recommended QR encryption methods may not be an ideal solution.  But, these are also the best options known after years of effort to see what can protect against quantum capabilities.  So BTC may have to work within these constraints.  


The goal of course will be to minimize disruption and provide the necessary time to develop and allow users to make the transition if necessary.

Below are some projects with QR label that I have been giving updates as quantum gets more attention.  Their main focus isn't just being prepared for quantum resistance, but they stand to benefit from the narrative since they have planned for quantum resistance all along.  In the end, all chains and systems will need to prepare.  The question will be how well they navigate this.  Being prepared from the beginning offers obvious advantages.

QANX- still making a steady climb ahead of its mainnet push. Recent news of an EU country utilizing the QR tech stack with ethereum board member Patrick Storchenegger part of the partnership. ETH like design, PoS, with evm compatible multi-language smart contracts and dev royalties.

CELL- had a nice run-up since Jan. A decent pullback recently which might offer opportunity. Appears to be more of a DOT type design. Had a Coin Bureau club review video which didn't do much, but some buzz around Kelvpn seems to be helping.

QRL- Built for QR years ago, and was quiet until recently. May have been because it was hard to buy, but Mexc was added, and they are working to add in evm and smart contracts.  Seems to be holding it's new level.

Algo- Most are familiar, it appears to have added Falcon as quantum resistance for consensus purposes, but I haven't seen if they have a solution defined for Digital Signature- which is the primary issue Vitalik was prepared for.

XX, AME, XEP and a few others I know less about have also been mentioned for preparing.

Bitcoin maxi culture feels like a cult.,"Everytime I interact with a BTC maxi I get the feeling like I am talking to a brainwashed cult member. They seem to hold unwavering and absolute beliefs in the superiority of Bitcoin over all other cryptocurrencies/assets.

They tend to view the world in binary terms, where Bitcoin is seen as the one true solution to all monetary problems, while all other cryptocurrencies are dismissed as unworthy or fraudulent. This lack of nuance mirrors the black-and-white thinking often found in cult ideologies.

They exhibit hostility towards dissent and are fiercely defensive of their beliefs and often respond with  resentment to any criticism or questioning of Bitcoin's supremacy. This intolerance of dissenting opinions can create an echo chamber effect within the community. I have lost count of how many BTC  people have blocked me for even mentioning other coins.

They have a strong emotional attachment to Bitcoin's success. This emotional investment, is combined with the belief in Bitcoin's inevitable triumph and a ""Us versus them"" mentality. 

All the above makes me feel like 2024 Bitcoin maxis are slowly becoming a cult, blocking out all outside voices and forming their little bubble.

Everything to know (so far) about Moons on Arbitrum One.,"**The Bridge is open and Moons are on Arbitrum One. Here's everything you need to know about Moons on Arbitrum One.**

\_\_\_

**Number 1:** Moons are not Migrating you don't need to do anything with your Moons on Nova. This simply opens the door to be able to use Moons on both Nova and One.

\_\_\_

**Number 2:** There are two ways to Bridge Moons between Nova and One.

* Option 1 is the [Official Arbitrum Bridge](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/?destinationChain=ethereum&sourceChain=arbitrum-nova) \- this method takes seven days and requires multiple transaction on mainnet ETH so it requires lots of gas, and shouldn't be used unless you're bridging large amounts of Moons between Nova and One.

* Option 2 is the [Celer Bridge](https://cbridge.celer.network/42170/42161/MOON), this Bridge goes directly between Nova and One using User Provided Liquidity Pools on both sides. This allows users to earn Liquidity Fees with 0 impermanent loss. I have a write up on how the pools works [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1bjxom1/celer_bridge_incentive_overview_and_liquidity/).

**Number 3:** How to add Arbitrum One and Moons to your Hot Wallet.

Unlike Nova, Arbitrum One is an incredibly easy network to add to your Hot Wallet. (below are the steps for MetaMask)

While on the Arbitrum One Network - Select the ""Tokens"" Tab -> Press ""Import tokens"" -> Enter the following Token Contract Address **0x24404DC041d74cd03cFE28855F555559390C931b** \-> Press ""Next"" -> Press ""Import"".

You can now see Moons as an Asset in your hot wallet on Arbitrum One.

\_\_\_

**Number 4:** How to buy and sell Moons on Arbitrum One.

Liquidity for Moons is currently being added to Camelot. [This link](https://app.camelot.exchange/) takes you to the trading page on Camelot to buy and sell Moons on Arbitrum One.

Currently there is $252K in Moon/Eth liquidity on Camelot.

\_\_\_

**Number 5:** Why Camelot?

The answer is Arbitrum Rewards for liquidity providers. Although these are not live for Moons yet - Camelot has a grant from the Arbitrum Foundation to subsidize liquidity providers on Camelot with ARB tokens. So growing TVL and Volume on Camelot will allow Moon Liquidity Providers to start seeing extra rewards in the form of ARB.

Once Camelot offers ARB rewards - I will look at making a guide on how to add liquidity to Camelot, if you want to add liquidity before then you can do so using [this link](https://app.camelot.exchange/pools/0x5e27A422ec06A57567a843FD65A1BBB06aC19FC0).",CryptoCurrency,https://reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1bl4uwy/everything_to_know_so_far_about_moons_on_arbitrum/,2024-03-22 13:27:36,0.11274651274651275,0.39966931216931223,0.005,0.056,0.9604

"Newbie advice: Not looking for gains, just don't want massive losses","I hope I don't get flack for this, but I'm not only a crypto newbie but a total trading Luddite. I got a coinbase account, no wallet, for the purpose of being able to purchase from sites that offer discounts for buying with crypto. I have no real interest in buying crypto to make a profit or really looking to trade, I did all my pre-purchase checks and read the stuff coinbase asks you to as well as some of my own research so I know that getting fully into crypto isn't really for me.

One thing I'm not sure of though is knowing what to buy that has moderate fluctuation in value so as to not log in to make a purchase and find that £100 or so in coins I have in my account has suddenly dipped to being worth nothing (yes, I know losing everything is a risk in any investment)

I have (very small) amounts of USDC, Bitcoin Cash, and Cosmos, to use/trade into other coins or make purchases with.

I saw that Bitcoin has had some dips in market value, but this is \`normal\` for before a halving (still learning what that is)

**Would the advice for a newb like me to not bother keeping anything in my account and just purchase coins when I want to use crypto to buy items, or could investing a small (like, £100 or so) amount into Bitcoin right now be a safe way to maybe bump up my future spending money?**

&#x200B;

I've been on this hell planet, and used the internet, long enough to know that nothing is a sure bet. But I just want to have the facts and tools behind me to feel comfortable holding small amounts without taking on bigger risks.

Four Months of RCC Performance Tracking! What's in store for the future?,"Happy Friday Everyone! Hope you're brackets aren't too busted up after yesterday! My 5 year old actually picked the Oakland upset of Kentucky (how could she not pick them when their mascot is the Golden Grizzlies haha!). 

Hard to believe I'm now four months into this journey tracking RCCs. I'm sure some of you all get tired of seeing my posts each week, but my reason for starting this was to try and bring more exposure to our space and the various subs and to see if there are any diamonds in the rough that may be worth holding onto long term. I'll have the weekly data and monthly updates in this post so take a look and see if there's anything that jumps out to you.

Here's the data from last week 3.15.24:

https://preview.redd.it/lx0u7aogawpc1.png?width=685&format=png&auto=webp&s=a893153f816b71569e263e903fa2225d7b7995d7

And here's the data I pulled this morning 3.22.24:

https://preview.redd.it/ww711vbgawpc1.png?width=713&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c0dda1c543860bd5bc9e16abdd86e8e7cee74a3

1. I think it's quite obvious that they first thing jumping off the page is the move MOON has had over the last week. Seemingly out of nowhere it pumped majorly, has overtaken Banano and seems to be setting itself up for some consolidation. People are bullish (and/or FOMOing) on moons again and I think that's good news for all RCCs. Bricks also made a huge move over the last week but I have a hard time taking that coin seriously.
2. The top three meme coins slid just a bit this week. Seeing MOONs and Bricks made me think that the first trickle down effect from large caps pumping is taking place and people are moving from top tier meme coins down to the more risky (market cap wise) plays. So I think it's quite possible our RCCs are in for some interesting movements in the coming weeks. 
3. CONE I think is the winner of the week for Polygon RCCs. Gained a bit of market cap while most others slid. Hopefully we're getting some consolidation at these levels and I'm looking forward to seeing what is to come. We might finally get to drop that next zero for good sooner than later.
4. Don't want to discount GODL, they had a really really nice week of gains, probably the biggest mover for the RCCs. Looks to be on a bullish trajectory as well. I'll speak on TACO here as well, good to see them holding strong. It has been a huge boon for them getting linked up with the big tacos sub and I think that is extremely bullish for their future.
5. Most of the rest had a rather disappointing week, everyone else dropped or were flat. So not much to say about them. Hopefully we can get a bounce back week coming up (maybe what I said earlier will ring true and we'll see more trickle down).

\---------------------------

And now for the monthly data!

Updates on the Market Cap Percent Change from 11.24.23 through 3.22.24:

https://preview.redd.it/4ct400ueawpc1.png?width=633&format=png&auto=webp&s=afa7ed73f5a889a4df7ae2df795f1913752a4d33

As you can see we've had some booms and busts over the past month. The percentages are based from where I initially started collecting the data. PEPE has made a huge move and TACO continues to be the best investment going back to November.

Updates on the Wallet Holders Percent Change from 11.24.23 through 3.22.24:

https://preview.redd.it/2chl73geawpc1.png?width=633&format=png&auto=webp&s=bbaf1ba887be51f491de0c9c2e6335f5b7c4e193

In this chart what I'm looking for is some consistent growth of those green numbers. CONE, TACO, DOGE would be good examples.

Updates on the Sub Members Percent Change from 11.24.23 through 3.22.24:

https://preview.redd.it/nmh8vbvdawpc1.png?width=633&format=png&auto=webp&s=4eac37216cf9969e870826c45f330030a8fffbc1

This info kinda speaks for itself, tracking sub growth since I started tracking this data point in January. I'm most interested in this data for the subs that have not officially released their tokens yet to see how the growth hits them once they got added to the CommunityPointsBot umbrella and then once their token is released.

That's it for today, I know pretty much nobody reads down this far but after this week I'm going to take a look at cutting back on the number of subs I'm posting in. Any feedback on that would be appreciated! I've kicked around just sticking to the subs with higher member numbers and I feel like the posts would tend to just get lost so like I said, thinking through it.

However, others argue that there may be better buying opportunities on certain weekdays. 

I remember one suggestion I had heard was to DCA on Sunday night, as markets tend to be less volatile and prices might be lower after the weekend.  

Obviously the decision of when to DCA depends on our own individual financial goals and the response may be that “every day is a good day to DCA.” I was just wondering if there is a preference out there in the community and if so, what’s the logic behind that.

"AMA Announcement: Unveiling the Future of Decentralized AI and Software Development with Tau Net ($AGRS) - March 25th, 6pm UTC - 1500 USDT Giveaway"," Greetings, r/Cryptocurrency community!

We're thrilled to announce that the Tau Net team will be hosting an AMA session right here on **March 25th at 6pm UTC**. This is your chance to dive deep into the innovative world of Tau Net & Agoras ($AGRS), a project at the forefront of reshaping how we conceive software development and decentralized AI.

**1500 USDT Giveaway**

To make this AMA extra special, we're giving away **1500 USDT** to the top 15 questions (100 USDT each). Share your most insightful, curious, or inspiring questions for a chance to win.

**Who We Are**

We are Tau (www.tau.net), a ten year old software company pioneering **logical AI** software development. We’ve developed a novel formal specification language, called Tau Language, intended for precise and accurate development of mission critical systems and complex software. Our novel use of formal specification enables **correct-by-construction software development**, thereby eliminating many of the problems that software development and machine learning AI still face, e.g. bugs, traditional testing costs, hefty maintenance, AI hallucination and many technical barriers to participation in development, ultimately enabling anyone to be a developer.

**What is Tau Net**

Tau Net is a decentralized blockchain network fully controlled, governed and developed by its entire user base in a sound manner. By allowing all users to write information in its system e.g. human knowledge, personal opinions and desired behavior for the system to function in logical sentences that work as formal specifications, these sentences are directly executable and thereby function as working software. Tau Net logically reasons over the collective requirements given by its users and detects the agreement on how they want it to function, and puts its own next version as the next block in its blockchain, evolving from block to block, resulting in rapid collaborative development.

**Agoras: Currency of Tau**

Agoras is the currency of Tau Net. $AGRS pioneers in facilitating the exchange of knowledge, computational assets, and derivatives within the Tau Net ecosystem. Uniquely, $AGRS stands as the world’s first token with user-controlled tokenomics. Users describe in logical sentences how they want $AGRS to be like and Tau Net automatically detects and implements the agreement as executable software, empowers Tau Net’s users to effortlessly modify the tokenomics, simply by voicing their desired specification.

**What are our breakthroughs?**

NVIDIA’s CEO shares a vision similar to our future of Software and AI ([https://x.com/Carnage4Life/status/1761483377365152234?s=20](https://x.com/Carnage4Life/status/1761483377365152234?s=20)).

Tau Net introduces the concept of ""Software as Sentences."" This is a new method of developing software, utilizing executable formal specifications, different from code and typical machine learning e.g. ChatGPT. It enables users to describe how they want the network to be like in logical sentences. These logical sentences are processed and understood by the network and directly executable as software, accurate according to the description. Agoras ($AGRS) leverages this technology to allow user-controlled tokenomics, and a decentralized marketplace for knowledge, derivatives, and computational resources.

**Redefining AI: Logic-based AI vs. ML-based AI**

Today’s most popular AI applications (ChatGPT, Bard, etc) rely on machine learning, a probabilistic approach which is unable to guarantee accurate results. Contrarily, Tau Net employs logic-based AI, thereby being able to handle logical reasoning and deduce new facts from given knowledge, all while guaranteeing that the result is completely accurate according to knowledge provided. In addition, Tau Net is also able to explain to the user how it arrived at a result. Therefore, Tau Net is superior in its reasoning capabilities compared to machine learning based alternatives. By offering formal proofs of correctness, it addresses a pivotal challenge in the AI domain achieving absolute certainty in outcomes.

**User-Controlled Software and AI Governance**

On Tau Net, users are granted unprecedented control over the network. Tau Net provides an effective solution to the AI alignment problem by enabling users to define rules or embed regulations directly within its software. These rules are adhered to with proof, even after any future updates. It possesses the unique capability to automatically reject any attempts at tampering with its software, especially if such attempts aim to introduce undesired behavior. For instance, if the command ""Never send private data over the network"" is embedded, Tau Net will consistently honor this rule, automatically rejecting any future updates that contravene it. This level of software integrity and compliance is unparalleled in the technology domain and important to ensure system integrity.

**Unlocking AGI: Collective Intelligence and Combined Brainpower on Tau Net**

On Tau Net, collective intelligence emerges as users input their knowledge via descriptions in logical sentences enabled by Tau Language. Tau Net is able to reason over given knowledge, as well as combining knowledge and thereby deducing new enlightening facts and groundbreaking discoveries. Every piece of knowledge becomes maximally useful, lying dormant until connected with another fact, potentially yielding solutions to some of the world's biggest problems. This synergy propels Tau Net on the fastest path towards realizing AGI, marking a pivotal shift in how we harness and leverage collective intelligence for humanity’s betterment. Furthermore, this paradigm facilitates a knowledge market to trade and connect knowledge and brain power using $AGRS.

**Conclusion**

While many blockchain initiatives, such as Bitcoin, proclaim decentralization, they operate under centralized development teams. Contrarily, Tau Net may be described as a decentralized, expansive reasoning system, that empowers users to contribute information that simultaneously serves as software, which Tau Net is able process and integrate into subsequent versions. This unique approach fosters mass collective intelligence, enabling rapid, robust collaborative development, and truly decentralizes the development process in a coherent manner.

**Upcoming Milestones: Tau Language & Testnet**

We're on the brink of releasing the **Tau Language and Testnet**, major milestones that will significantly enhance our ecosystem's capabilities. These developments are a testament to our commitment to innovation and our vision for a decentralized future.

**Join Us: AMA Details and Resources**

Mark your calendars for **March 25th at 6pm UTC** and prepare your questions. Whether you're curious about the technical aspects, the vision behind Tau Net, or how you can get involved, we're here to answer.

As you can see, the hype began from the 20th to the 43rd trading day and stabilized from the 44th to the 46th. The slowdown started from the 47th day until now.

Imagine if the net inflow of Bitcoin ETFs continues to decrease. Will the market experience a significant downturn as well?

If the market is no longer hyped about Bitcoin ETFs, what factors will drive Bitcoin to continue its journey to $100K?

Europe's Blockchain Evolution: LTO - Bridging Real World Assets and DeFi,"Hey Reddit,

Dive into how Europe is leading a blockchain revolution, cleverly merging Real World Assets (RWA) with the digital age of decentralized finance (DeFi). Forget the complexity; think of blockchain as the new digital bridge making asset ownership and transfers as simple and secure as sending an email.

At present, the blockchain hosts approximately $1.3 billion in Real-World Assets (RWAs), with the sector expanding to a market value of $1.05 billion in 2023 alone. A significant portion of this growth, about 82% or $855.7 million, originated from sectors such as treasuries, real estate, and private credit. Recognized figures in both the conventional finance and cryptocurrency spheres are heralding RWAs as the next big leap in crypto's growth journey. Projections suggest that by the year 2030, the on-chain presence of RWAs could skyrocket to an impressive $16 trillion.

This surge in RWAs on the blockchain highlights a transformative period where digital and physical asset worlds converge, reflecting Europe's pioneering role in this space.

Enter LTO Network, a great example of this evolution. It's not just another blockchain platform; it's Europe's beacon for integrating business operations with blockchain, making real-world asset tokenization a reality. This platform stands out with its hybrid architecture—combining the best of both worlds: public and private layers. This means enhanced security, privacy, and efficiency, all while keeping things scalable and compliant.

LTO Network is on a mission to not just adapt but to lead in the RWA space. By focusing on tokenizing real assets and ensuring seamless integration with DeFi, LTO is creating a future where digital and physical assets coexist on a secure, transparent blockchain platform, aiming for significant market growth and introducing initiatives like the EQTY platform to further bridge DeFi and RWAs.

In essence, LTO Network embodies Europe's innovative approach to blockchain, offering a practical solution where technology meets traditional finance, driving towards a future of decentralized, efficient, and inclusive financial ecosystems.

SCAM or LEGIT: Celunex.com for trading? ,"I’ve been getting into CryptoCurrency exchange for some months now, and Celunex.com pops up every now and then. My question is, it is a legit site or is it a scam? Since investing money on websites like it is literally a hit or miss, and there isn’t much information about it on internet. Has anyone ever worked with it? How is it running? Is it safe to work with it or has anyone had any troubles? Google isn’t providing much information, but some articles do say that it is a full blown scam site. Thanks!

"Crypto (defi) is turning mainstream, but not the way you think","Normally the argument I hear in crypto is that it needs to go mainstream for it to become fully successful. Mainstream to them is when everyone can easily use it, sorta like going on the internet and typing in you tube, and watching cat videos - (hurray the internet is now fully successful since your grandma can binge cat videos.)

But that's not how crypto will be unfortunately. Crypto will always be somewhat complicated and ""risky"" to every inexperienced person. And that's because crypto allows the ultimate low level access. Complete control of their assets. But the new emerging markets will be middle men services that will do this work for you, for a fee. It will evolve mainstream to the point where you can ""easily"" use crypto, but there will always be some ""fee"" unknown to the user. Just like moving coins from layer to layer, there will be services that do all this for you in the background, without you even having to know what the hell ""gas"" is.

Now I know you're thinking, oh shady exchanges do this for us right now. While that's true, these exchanges are mostly unregulated and can screw over many people. The future will be A LOT of regulation, but also utilizing native crypto blockchains frequently. It will be safer, more transparent, stable and a HUGE market!

Just like BlackRock announcing the future is tokenizing assets, just wait until your homes deed is a coin, and you pay someone to manage it. It's already begun, that's where mainstream crypto is going, but the BEST part is we will ALWAYS have the choice to control coins ourself, but at the risk of our own mistakes.",CryptoCurrency,https://reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1bkqhzr/crypto_defi_is_turning_mainstream_but_not_the_way/,2024-03-22 00:05:41,0.2168747918747919,0.6012279387279388,0.072,0.144,0.9804
Historical Data Scanning/Screening for Crypto Pairs?,"Hey guys, im looking to investigate trading in crypto markets. I have plenty of familiarity with the general markets as someone who has been a crypto user for many years, however ive ran into a bit of a dilemma.

I want to deploy a strategy alongside a scanner/screener that will alert for me whenever certain volume, price, and market cap criteria are met. This sort of opportunistic approach to trading cryptocurrencies seems to be common, but how do you go about backtesting such a system if I dont know when my scanner alerted in the past?

Im looking for a scanner that offers DATE as an input parameter, so I can look at what my scanner would have outputted on a prior historical date. This sort of tool is surprisingly hard to come by. Even in stock trading I had to search quite hard to find this sort of tool, especially for a reasonable price. I already have historical charts, I just need to know what my scanner would have alerted.

The closest thing ive found so far that is helpful is [this CMC link](https://coinmarketcap.com/historical/) that provides basic price, market cap, and volume info on some historical dates. Purchasing/acquiring .csv time and sales data *might* be an option, however it will be difficult to work with (id have to sort through (and purchase) data for every single crypto pair), and is the worst case scenario. For comparison, I use [ChartMill](https://www.chartmill.com/stock/stock-screener) right now for stock trading (its truly an incredibly powerful tool, I highly recommend it for stock traders), im looking for something EXACTLY like this, except for coins. My last resort is to compile the data myself by just documenting my scanner alerts for the next few months...

Any advice is helpful, thanks.",CryptoCurrency,https://reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1bkqgzr/historical_data_scanningscreening_for_crypto_pairs/,2024-03-22 00:04:04,-0.01945578231292517,0.4120153061224489,0.047,0.108,0.9638
Strump is a different and  wiser crypto coin investment ,"This is different than other coins of only for the next year. Strump will be tied to the passion of the ex-president's passionate base, and interest will rise as the election draws closer. What's more, once people learn that 0.8% of the supertrump.io wallet goes to Trump, and if enough people get involved this could even help with the insane fines imposed by on him by a sadly weaponized ""judicial"" system the dems are using as a the only way they know to slow him down. But everyone--even far the left--sees through this and cringes. 

The point is, there are very real world and very important events tied to this coin, and it is just a matter of time and publicity, and word catching on about Trump before this coin soars. This is the sort of concept coin that people will be kicking themselves not jumping in on this coin now.  Compared to all other meme coins which have no innate, massive fan case and built in donation component, the STRUMP coin makes more sense than any other coin out there--and certainly more sense than any meme coin. I predict $0.56 cents by the summer of 2024, and possible coordinated resistance there to represent the soon to be 56th President of the United States. Dare we say $56 by December post election?

Ever wondered how do nodes find each other on the Bitcoin network? I assume most of you didn't hear about seed nodes / DNS nodes.,"https://academy.bit2me.com/en/que-es-un-nodo-semilla/

These nodes are run by trusted members of Bitcoin devteam. These servers are the gates before entering the network. 

Is there any risk of disruption? I assumed cryptos were by design completely trustless. Meaning youd need to pull the electricity to take it down, that's how robust I assumed it was. Cuz even theres a node on a Satellite. 

Now a human built design when it comes to money will be trident tested. This feature seems like the human element. And going by Murphy's eventually there will be a hickup somewhere. 

As I learnt about ICANN and IANA where IANA to this day is responsible for the root zone getting signed each month for the internet to ""run"" this had me wondering that if a big enough nation would go after Bitcoin wouldnt this seed node part be a surface of attack?",CryptoCurrency,https://reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1bklvf6/ever_wondered_how_do_nodes_find_each_other_on_the/,2024-03-21 20:12:06,0.020634920634920634,0.29126984126984123,0.069,0.06,0.0

Whats the best way to put the political voting system onto the blockchain?,"I feel like this would solve a lot of voting fraud problems, but i cant imagine voting by sending a token to a wallet of a politican as a common way to vote. 

So what if we just get a QR Code or something else, that you get toghter with your voting piece of paper, that basically tracks the voting paper (which represents a Voting token on the blockchain). And once the voting is completed, each VotingToken gets put into the wallet of the Politican you voted for, and later on you are able to track your Token on the blockchain to see if that token actually ended up in the right wallet.

DCA strategy using the Fear & Greed Index - Surprising Results [FOLLOW UP],"A few weeks ago I downloaded all historical data from the Fear and Greed Index, and wrote a backtesting script in python. **I wanted to find out how DCA performed if you increased your DCA amount the more FEARFUL the market was, and invested very little during times of greed.** The post is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1bb963s/dca_strategy_using_the_fear_greed_index/).

**Tons of people asked me to incorporate selling** during EXTREME GREED, and also pointed out **other metrics** they wanted me to test. So here it is!

**Start date:  March 17th  2018**  
**End Date:  September 9th 2023 (Bottom or Top is not a fair end date)**  


# 1. Benchmark DCA 

Traditional “vanilla” DCA to measure our results against. 

* $100 invested each 7 days

# 2. Fear & Greed DCA NO SELLING

Each 7 days we check the F&G index and invest:

* $150 if “Extreme Fear”  
$100 if “Fear”  
$75 if “Neutral”  
$50 if “Greed”  
$25 if “Extreme Greed”

# 3. Fear & Greed DCA WITH SELLING

Each 7 days we check the F&G index and:

* $150 if “Extreme Fear”  
$100 if “Fear”  
$75 if “Neutral”  
$50 if “Greed”  
Sell 5% of accumulated BTC if “Extreme Greed”

# 4. PI Cycle Top Indicator

More than one person asked me to test this one. The PI cycle top is the 111D and the 350D MA x2. It can be found [here](https://studio.glassnode.com/metrics?a=BTC&m=indicators.PiCycleTop) for example. The idea is when the 111D cross above the 350Dx2, you should run for the hills.   
Each 7 days we check if the 111D is below the 350Dx2 and:

* $100 invested if below  
Sell everything if above

# 5. AlphaSquared Risk Model DCA

The top comment mentioned this one. I signed up for a free account to test it so you don’t have to.  I used their default “Aggressive” strategy with 0% profits reinvested. 

Each 7 days we check the risk and:

* $130 if risk if 0/100  
$120 if risk is 20/100  
$50 if risk is 55/100….. And so on  
Sell 30% if risk 80/100   
Sell 70% of if risk 90/100

&#x200B;

# 6. Drumroll.......The results!

&#x200B;

|Strategy|ROI (Returns)|Portfolio Value (BTC)| Amount Invested|SATS per Dollar|Profit/Loss ($)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|DCA|**124.81%**|**2.48 BTC**|**$28 600**|**8 680**|**$35,694**|
|F&G NO SELL|**140.09%**|**2.64 BTC**|**$28.000**|**9 425**|**$40,346**|
|F&G W/ SELL|**184.18%**|**3.08 BTC**|**$28,125**|**10 973**|**$51,800**|
|PI Cycle Top Indicator|**332.44%**|**4.71BTC**|**$28,200**|**16 697**|**$93,748**|
|AlphaSquared Risk Metric|**385.00%**|**5.23 BTC**|**$28,030**|**18 756**|**$108,127**|

*\* Final Value (BTC) = The value of your entire portfolio in BTC. We value like this since even for the strategies where you sell to fiat, you can immediately convert it to BTC at the final price if you like.*  
*\* SATS per dollar = Wealth-in-BTC / Amount-Invested*  


# IMPORTANT!!

**This is just my testing and ideally you should conduct these tests across several time frames.** I might actually do that because I think these results warrant a more thorough investigation using confidence intervals or statistical significance. For example, both PI Cycle Top and AlphaSquared was created after 2018 so you want to adjust for that. That would take some more effort though, **so please let me know if that’s something you guys are interested in**.   


**Regardless these are very convincing results in favor of adjusting your DCA strategy. Hope you find it useful in the upcoming bull!**

Any crypto swing traders out there?,Been in a crypto game a long while and have been dabbling in some test swing trades using coinmarketcap. The volatility of crypto really is appealing for a swing trader. I've identified a few coins that would be fairly good to start swing trading (regularly swing 5-8%).

Approaches for setting realistic price targets?,"I‘m having a hard time setting realistic price targets for my little coins and tokens when it comes to selling. The first levels that I started with got partially overrun much quicker than I thought.  
I mostly set 3 or 4 levels for each asset. I hold about 20 coins/tokens (yeah, ik ik, leave me alone) of which a few are only waiting to become break-even to be sold. But for some others I expect the last levels somewhere around their ATH.

"Some MetaMask clarification needed, please...","Hey, as you'll probably see below, I'm pretty dumb when it comes to on-chain activity and wallets so please have some patience with me... 

So I recently got a new PC and I've just added MetaMask to that new machine.

On the old PC, I opened additional accounts besides the original ones to mess around with some BSC shitcoins, but now I can not find that account on top of the MetaMask. When I click on top to switch between accounts, it only shows the ""Account 1"" and the options to add others (add new, recover with private key or add a hardware wallet).

Does that mean if I don't have the private key to those other accounts, they're lost?

I don't remember what coins they were, probably dead, but I want to use this as a learning opportunity since I still keep most of my stuff on exchanges, and if it turns out I blew the accounts, there's a good reason to keep it that way...

Thanks in advance!

Clarification Please: What is Benjamin Cowen suggesting?,"I am having difficulty fully understanding BC’s thesis. What I understand it to be (from virtually all of Benjamin Cowen’s recent videos) is that he basically is suggesting that BTC is very near its top, and if it holds the eight week SMA, there could be one final push higher. Is he suggesting that’s it for the entire cycle? Or just in the short term?

Also, he constantly goes on and on about BTC only pumping higher if alt coins durably break down against their BTC pairs, meaning their valuations drop against BTC. So, is he also suggesting that there will not be any kind alt season where alts pump drastically against BtCs valuation after BTC tops (which we have seen in every cycle)? 

He keeps going back to the 2019 mid cycle pump and suggesting that that move is the same as this one — but he fails to mention the halving at all, or the fact that BTC has just broke an all time high… the two moves are very different IMO, or am I missing something? 

To me this current move (and market move in general) is more similar to the 2021 peak, which was followed by a massive pump in alt coin valuations.

Can anyone provide more clarity or deeper context as to what he’s suggesting? 

Basically that BTC is approaching a cycle peak, and that altcoins will crash after the BTc cycle tops, and that there will be no alt season? Is that what he’s saying?

Would you be interested in a P2P management app?,"I am creating a **free** web app for those who trade P2P or OTC. Primarily I was developing it for myself but then thought why not ask the community. Let me know what you think.  


**Problem statement:** P2P and OTC trading is not safe when fiat currency is involved. With strict corruption and anti-money laundering laws, banks can freeze your account at any time. If you haven't already been affected, consider yourself lucky. People have narrated their horror stories about how a seemingly straightforward crypto transaction resulted in the freezing of lifetime savings. This risk may be high or low depending on your country but it's there.

**Solution**: A bookkeeping software specially designed with crypto in mind. You would be able to trace down any given P2P transaction and store/retreive counterparty information. This would serve as documentary evidence that your link with the malicious counterparty was strictly transactional and you could forward the relevant information (id/phone etc) to the authorities.  
As a bonus, the app could also calculate taxes based on your transaction history.

Celsius suing people who withdrew before bankruptcy?,"Just spotted a tweet from an influencer getting hit with a lawsuit from Celsius for withdrawing a hefty sum before their bankruptcy declaration. It’s one of those “preference liability” claims, aiming to reel in funds taken out by the fast movers in the days leading up to their financial crash. The kicker? They’re offering a settlement to close the deal at a discount.... seems kind of scammy from Celsius?

The tweet: https://twitter.com/Zata_Zu/status/1770502728738857005 



Legal jargon is as clear as mud, and international laws on crypto are as consistent as Bitcoin’s price on a bad day.

The gist of the claim is about 'fairness'—Celsius says that late withdrawals (before they went bankrupt, mind you) left less in the pot for everyone else. They're using the old bankruptcy rulebook to try and balance the books, but when it comes to overseas account holders, things get murky.

Do international waters protect you from US bankruptcy law? Should you pay up, negotiate, or wait it out? While I’m no lawyer, and this isn’t legal advice, it's a tough call without some legit counsel, especially when different countries have their own take on cryptocurrency regulations.

Celer Bridge Incentive Overview and Liquidity Guide.,"**The Celer Bridge is live and you likely want to know:**

* **Are the incentives to provide bridge liquidity for Moons worth it?**
* **If so how do you provide liquidity?**

This post aims to answer both of these questions.

\---------------------

# Are the incentives to provide bridge liquidity for Moons worth it?

In order to answer this question we first need to understand how the Moon Nova/One bridge works. Importantly this bridge works by users Pooling Moons on both Nova and One, which then allows others users to Transfer Moons to a Pool on one side and then receive Moons from a pool on the other side of the bridge.

*I.E. A user transferring ten Moons from Nova to One would send ten Moons to the Pool on Nova and receive ten moons minus fees from the pool on One.*

**Because the only thing being moved back and forth is Moons and you will always receive more Moons (fees) after someone uses your Pooled Moons to bridge. This allows users to farm Moon rewards with zero impermanent loss.**

\-----

In this way - on paper, it is theoretically worth it for anyone to provide Bridge Liquidity as they earn extra Moons when their Moons are used by someone else to bridge to/from nova and one.

However there are a few more considerations to make.

1. Do we know what APY looks like?
2. What are the 3rd party risks?

To Answer Question 1:

* APY of the bridge is based on supply/demand of the bridge until more time has passed we don't know what average supply/demand will look like.
   * I.E. If no one Bridges, Bridge Providers don't make fees and if lots of bridging occurs providers make a lot in fees.
* To incentivize individuals to provide Bridge Liquidity Celer announced they'll be paying out 285K Celer tokens over the first 60 days that the bridge is live. (APY for this reward will be subject to total Bridge Supply on both Nova and One.) 

To Answer Question 2:

* Whenever you place Moons in the custody of a 3rd party you open yourself to a 3rd party risk. It doesn't matter if that's with a CEX like Kraken, a DEX like Camelot/Sushi, or a Bridging Service like Celer. If something happens like a hack/exploit, you could lose your Moons that are in the custody of the third party.

Given the fact that rewards come with Zero Impermanent Loss you have to decide if the third party risk makes sense for you to farm Celer Bridge Rewards, and if it does the amount of Moons you want to provide Bridge Liquidity with.

\---------------------

# How do you provide liquidity?

Providing Liquidity on Celer is incredibly Simple. First go to the Liquidity Page for the Celer Bridge.

[https://cbridge.celer.network/liquidity](https://cbridge.celer.network/liquidity)

Once there connect your wallet that you will be providing Bridge liquidity with - once you've connected your wallet you can search Moon to find the Moon Pool or alternatively scroll through the pools until you see the Moon pool.

Once you've found it expand the section and press the plus sign to add liquidity for Moons on Arbitrum Nova or Arbitrum One. **Importantly you do not need to provide Bridge Liquidity on both sides.**

https://preview.redd.it/yj5fyplu5ppc1.png?width=1439&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab633a4d7da721752af906df73bb5a2823d825b3

*For this example I will be providing Liquidity on Nova. (but it's the same idea for One)*

Press the add Liquidity button *(it will prompt you to switch to Arbitrum Nova if you are not already there, switch to Arbitrum Nova find the Moon Pool and press Add Liquidity again)* and the following page will load.

**Important note: You must provide more than 35 Moons in Bridge Liquidity (35.1 works, 35 does not)**

Approve the Moons in your wallet,

https://preview.redd.it/zbw3dmjp2mpc1.png?width=487&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e36b709a20a83a0e1c104bce312d6f91feea53d

**Important note 2: It is always recommended to ONLY APPROVE the total amount of Moons you'll be adding and never press Max.**

Once you approve the transaction the previous page will load for a few second and then show an Add Liquidity button.

Confirm the transaction in your wallet and wait!

Once the Transaction goes through you can then go back to the Moon Pool on Celer and you will now see your share of the liquidity on the display.

As people bridge to/from Nova and One your liquidity will move between the two pools.

You will need ETH on Arbitrum one and Arbitrum nova in order to initiate the bridge in either direction and to use MOON after completing the bridge. You can fund your wallet with ETH on both networks via [kraken,](https://www.kraken.com/) crypto.com, gate.io, [orbiter,](https://www.orbiter.finance/) or [arbitrum’s official bridge.](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/) Kraken put together a [great guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/KrakenSupport/s/CzVb1kxPWo) for users detailing how to recover your vault, connect to Arbitrum nova and fund your wallet with ETH.

# Step 2 - Bridge via Celer

Go to [Celer](https://cbridge.celer.network/42170/42161/MOON) and connect your wallet via metamask. Make sure you have Arbitrum nova selected as the source chain and Arbitrum one as the destination chain, and MOON as the selected token. Then input the number of MOON you wish to bridge, click the blue bridge button at the bottom, and confirm the prompted transaction in your metamask.

# Step 3 - Add MOON to Metamask on Arbitrum One

At the bottom of the home page on your metamask wallet you should see “Don’t see your token? Import tokens” with import tokens as a hyperlink. Click that hyperlink, and under contract address paste the following: [0x24404DC041d74cd03cFE28855F555559390C931b](https://arbiscan.io/token/0x24404dc041d74cd03cfe28855f555559390c931b) Then click import and your MOON balance will propagate.

It’s time to focus on cryptoCURRENCIES! ,"It’s in the name folks! CryptoCURRENCY coins are being overlooked, in my opinion. There are only 4 coins in the top 20 that focus solely on being a currency. 

In my opinion smart contract coins are biting off more they can chew. Making a crypto that is decentralized, secure and scalable is hard enough. Adding additional features like, smart contracts, dapps, DEXs, NFTs, data storage, and assets seems like a joke when you really start to think about it. Who thought this was a good idea, cough cough vitalik cough cough. What you end up with are products that are not decentralized, not secure and not scalable. Now they are introducing layers on top of layers, making everything so complicated and jumbled that no one can keep track of it. 

A lot of these “decentraized” exchanges have back doors and use cache and centralized servers to store all the excessive data. Also, they sell governance coins that are useless. People buy them and never actually vote on anything, just hope they pump. What a circus it has all become. 

Not only are these smart contract cryptos struggling with the trilemma they are struggling to even run, looking at you Solana. 

It is time we focus on cryptoCURRENCIES that have never failed, and have a laser focus goal, to become a currency. This was the original goal of bitcoin - to not rely on a middleman like banks or a government to purchase goods. These smart contract coins are mucking the waters and have become a huge distraction. I believe there is room for at least 5 cryptos that focus solely on being a currency. 

I am guilty of falling for the trap of believing that smart contract coins will change the world. But after going through a couple of cycles, I have realized that the good old dependable cryptoCURRENCIES are tried and true and will continue to thrive. 

Would love to hear everyone’s thoughts.

Why the main narratives around the top Crypto AI projects are all bullcrap,"Please note that this is a discussion about technology/protocol, not about price. Any Crypto AI memecoin can do super well in a bull market just by being associated with AI even if it does absolutely nothing useful. And that's what's widely happening.

**There are many problems with the top crypto AI projects, including**:

* Having extremely misleading marketing that doesn't match their technical documentation
* Having little to nothing to do with AI
* Having little to nothing to do with blockchains (aside from the token)
* Having failed economic incentives

Let's discuss the top 3.

**1. Render**

The Render Network has very little to do with AI or crypto, so Coingecko and Coinmarketcap really shouldn't be categorizing it as one. It uses Octane Render, which is a video GPU rendering platform, not an AI GPU platform. In addition, the Render Network website downplays the blockchain part, which makes sense because it's barely using blockchain technology.
	
The entire platform and process is off-chain. The market for GPU-as-a-Service existed and worked great without any blockchain. And that's what the Render Network does. **The only purpose for the RNDR token is as a payment token**. There are a few programs on Solana that assist with the payment system, and that's it. They could've used US dollars or SHIB or BabyDogeCumRocketInuPepeTrump to pay for the services, and it wouldn't have made a single difference.

**2. Fetch.ai**

Despite its name, Fetch.ai has no native AI capabilities. Its main trick is that it can play Fetch (e.g. url fetch).

Its main website is extremely misleading about AI chatbots because it can't make any. At least its developer documentation is more honest about its limitations.
	
Fetch is a platform used to make API requests to Virtual Agents (similar to extremely basic versions of M365 Power Platform Virtual Agents). These are [basic scripted non-AI chatbots](https://fetch.ai/docs/examples) similar to the ones you encounter when going through the menu of an automated phone system. They're very limited since you can't store an entire AI in a small python script. You could actually code the same natively on Ethereum using Solidity if it weren't so gas expensive, but this is probably possible now on L2s after the Dencun upgrade.

So why is Fetch claiming that it can assist with modeling AI chatbots? Because it's stretching the truth that it can obtain centralized data off-chain. Imagine talking to a virtual agent and paying for unverified responses that are all bullcrap.
	
Basically, Fetch Virtual Agents can make centralized API requests and get off-chain data. But the major problem is that the network has no way of auditing the accuracy of any external API calls. There is no way of getting accurate off-chain data without an oracle, and this is true for Fetch as well. Chainlink does this by requiring M out of N responses to agree with each other. Fetch protocol only gets 1 out of 1 response, so you can't trust the info unless you have established some trust with the Virtual Agent provider off-chain. It's basically a centralized API request service where you have to build up trust off-chain.

**3. BitTensor**
	
Bittensor is one of the closest projects to being AI-related. What it's actually supposed to do is very puzzling. Its ""About"" page describes itself multiple times as being very hard to understand, and is a rambling mess of words that feel like a AI chatbot wrote it back in 2005 before they were any good.

It's not AI. It's not machine learning. **It's a marketplace**. And it's totally up to its users to figure out what to do with it. (Hint: You can't design AI, LLM, or ML with it)

Fortunately, its technical documentation is much better at revealing what it does. It's a marketplace for subnets and miners. Each subnet has miners that create responses and validators that score those responses. The miners are then paid in TAO based on their scores.
	
Most describing BitTensor (and even Bankless) suggest that it's made for miners to create programs through machine learning. But if you read carefully, the BitTensor website does not promise or describe this.

The problem is that machine learning requires a controlled environment where the engineers control both the validators and the ML programs. In BitTensor, the engineers have no control over the miners. The miners can just get up and leave, and steal all the progress that was made. It's like OpenAI paid users to build AIs, spent the time to train them and validate, only to allow those builders to just keep the data, destroy it, sell it, or do whatever they want with it. The builders can hold the data hostage by threatening to leave and demand ransom. The end result is that the engineers do not own the data, so it makes no sense to use BitTensor for AI or machine learning.

It's cheaper and safer to pay for Infrastructure-as-a-Service within a controlled environment than on a decentralized blockchain.

However, there are still useful applications for BitTensor outside of AI-related purposes. If the engineer has a trapdoor function (some algorithm that takes orders of magnitude longer to solve than to validate), it could use the subnet to perform basic Proof of Work. They'd just be reinventing Bitcoin, but now with any custom algorithm instead of common ones like SHA-256, Keccak, and Scrypt. The subnet miners would just become literal PoW miners.

-----

**In conclusion**:

These tokens are doing so well even when their projects are horrible. Imagine how much they would pump if they updated into something actually useful.

Bitcoin is still up about 30% *THIS MONTH.*

I don’t know what world a lot of you guys are living in but 30% in a month is beyond Bullish.

The S&P 500 returns an average of 10% annually.

Berkshire Hathaway returns average around 20% a year.

Bitcoin has literally outperformed almost every other asset on the planet in this past year. But is it a straight line up??? *Hell No.* There will be Valley’s and Peaks if you want to see the top of the Mountain….

A very simple strategy for you newcomers:
***RED = BUY***, 
***GREEN = HODL***

***Do you Take Profits???*** *Absolutely Yes.* But anyone Taking these tiny profits now is probably going to end up FOMOing back in at a higher price when everything really takes off.

***Do you Sell when the market slightly dips??***
If you did, this game probably isn’t for you. Better off just buying an ETF that will return you 8% a year with minimal volatility. (NFA)

Stellar network holds the largest market cap of tokenized treasuries with over $355M,"This website shows analytics for tokenized real-world assets. On this page it shows some charts, one of which is the Market Cap by Network chart:  
[https://app.rwa.xyz/treasuries](https://app.rwa.xyz/treasuries)

Stellar and Ethereum are the largest shares with Stellar edging out above with over $355 million.

"What is the real cost of using Binance Convert to swap crypto? Binance say this Convert tool has no fees, but obviously Binance make their money by giving you a slightly worse price","The **Binance Convert** tool allows you to quickly convert one cryptocurrency to another.

Binance state that there are no fees for using this tool, but say that ""*every trade you make on Convert requires only a small spread in the corresponding Liquidity Pool*"". So Binance make their money via this spread, which no doubt results in you getting a slightly worse price for the crypto you buy.

But does anyone have any idea how much money you lose from this slightly worse price, as a percentage of the value of the crypto exchanged?

The normal fee Binance charges when you trade one cryptocurrency for another are 0.1% (or 0.075% if you pay your fees with BNB). How does the hidden cost of Binance Convert compare to this 0.1% fee?

Is crypto currency really that bad for the environment in comparison to fiat?,"Full transparency I am not educated enough on the topic but when you dwell on everything that fiat currency requires to be manufactures and sustained, is it really a big environmental difference? 

I obviously used chatGPT to consolidate my thoughts but looking for insight.

 

1. **Resource Extraction**: Many materials used in currency production, such as paper and metals (like nickel, copper, and zinc), require mining operations. Mining can lead to habitat destruction, soil erosion, water pollution, and biodiversity loss. Additionally, the energy-intensive nature of mining contributes to greenhouse gas emissions.
2. **Manufacturing**: The process of manufacturing currency involves energy-intensive processes such as printing, engraving, and minting. These processes often require significant amounts of electricity and water, contributing to carbon emissions and water usage. Chemicals used in the printing and engraving processes can also pose environmental risks if not properly managed.
3. **Transportation**: Raw materials, equipment, and finished currency products need to be transported between various locations, including mines, production facilities, central banks, and commercial banks. Transportation emissions from vehicles, ships, and planes contribute to air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. This includes the transportation costs of the individuals doing these processes.
4. **Maintenance**: Currency circulation requires ongoing maintenance of infrastructure, including bank branches, ATMs, and currency processing facilities. This maintenance involves energy consumption for heating, cooling, lighting, and other operational needs. Additionally, the disposal of worn-out or damaged currency notes and coins can pose environmental challenges if not managed properly.
5. **Waste Generation**: Currency production generates waste materials such as paper scraps, metal shavings, and chemicals used in the manufacturing process. Proper waste management practices are essential to minimize environmental impacts and prevent pollution of landfills, waterways, and ecosystems.
6. **Energy Consumption**: The entire lifecycle of fiat currency, from resource extraction to circulation and disposal, consumes significant amounts of energy. Much of this energy comes from fossil fuels, contributing to climate change and air pollution.
7. **Water Usage**: Currency production, particularly paper currency, requires substantial amounts of water for pulp processing and printing. Water consumption can strain local water supplies and ecosystems, especially in regions already facing water scarcity or pollution challenges.",CryptoCurrency,https://reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1bjm6y3/is_crypto_currency_really_that_bad_for_the/,2024-03-20 15:35:16,0.03888067061143985,0.37095660749506904,0.066,0.052,0.0

Does a crypto wallet like this even exist?," I'm interested in a wallet that functions exactly like a website page, with a social profile I guess? I made a quick sketch in photoshop.

Basically I'm interested in a simple webpage, where I can add a profile pic, name, a short bio and two or three crypto qr codes for different cryptocurrencies, to make payment simple and easy for anyone who visits it.

The profile pic, name and bio is a requirement, since it will be used in conjunction with other social media profiles and payment methods, and users need a simple non-technical way to know that they sent their money to the right guy.

And maybe if it has an option to connect metamask to the page it would be even better, to cover both mobile phone users and browser extension users.

Everywhere I've looked I only find browser extensions and they're not helpful at all :/

New UK crypto rules.,"T.L.D.R: I need the new rules the UK government have implemented for crypto.

So, I've recently had a big surge in price of a few assets I'm holding. So, I thought I'd take some of those gains and invest in a few new projects before the Bull kicks off. To start with, I unstaked my SOL on my Hot Wallet and swapped for a bunch of stable-coins, in anticipation of swapping them for new assets. Upon finishing swapping, I tried to re-stake the majority of my SOL again. Only to be told that I can no longer stake through my wallet. OK, I though, fair enough, I had heard about a few new rules introduced in the UK. That's shitty, but I'll cope. So, I transferred the stabecoin to my Phantom wallet and tried to swap the balance for the project that I was interested in, Only to be met with: ""This feature is not available in your country"".

The one advantage alt-L1s have over L2s,"While I regularly sing the praises of Ethereum L2s over alt-L1s, there is one advantage L1s have over L2s, and that is the ability to fallback to social consensus, via hard forks, to fix software bugs.

An L2's security depends entirely on a smart contract deployed on L1. That smart contract in turn cannot be altered via a hard fork in the event that it malfunctions. 

This owes primarily to the position held by Ethereum stakeholders at large that the underlying Ethereum protocol must never be altered to fix third party smart contracts.

The insistence against hard forking for application-layer fixes is correct in my opinion, as it ensures a credibly neutral platform, but it does impose a cost on Ethereum L2 security and thus usability.

The proposition of tens, perhaps of hundreds, of billions of dollars worth of capital moving to an L2 is daunting, as it requires that much capital being at risk of loss from a smart contract flaw. The Rollup's layer 1 contracts are also complex pieces of software with many potential places that may contain hidden flaws capable of causing catastrophic losses.

So what can be done? Well the solution would be to create enshrined Rollups which are not third party smart contracts where it would be forbidden to burden the L1 network with a hard fork to fix.

The correct operation of enshrined Rollups would be protected by layer 1 social consensus, so a malfunction would be fixed via a mainnet hard fork.

This would protect Ethereum from catastrophic layer 2 malfunctions and encourage migration to layer 2, which would massively improve Ethereum user experience and adoption.

By designating the Rollup as enshrined, the implicit promise of a Layer 1 hard fork to rectify any flaws in the Layer 2 smart contract does not compromise Layer 1's credible neutrality. This is because such intervention would not stem from arbitrary decisions by the social layer to address issues in the third-party application layer, which could imply favoritism towards specific applications, users, or developers. Instead, it relies on a structured, predetermined consensus mechanism for managing problems in critical infrastructure.",CryptoCurrency,https://reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1bjeeuw/the_one_advantage_altl1s_have_over_l2s/,2024-03-20 10:12:34,0.05095238095238094,0.45345630559916267,0.103,0.167,0.9763

"You are buying a Crypto-token. Not the whole ""blockchain"" that the coin is native to.","While it might seem intuitive that increased usage of a blockchain would directly correlate with an increase in the value of its native cryptocurrency token, this simplistic thinking falls apart long term.

The value of a crypto-token is influenced by supply and demand. More people using X chain because it has good UX, cheap fees or whatever will increase the demand for it's native token (Let's call it Xcoin) and thus the Market cap. But that's not the whole picture.

If for example every user on X chain is only transacting in stablecoins, pays no fees in Xcoin and has no reason to even hold Xcoin then it doesn't really have much value as a crypto asset. **Despite the fact that Xchain has wide adoption, strong userbase and tech quality.**

It's basically like buying Turkish Lira's because you think Turkey's economy will improve. Turkey's GDP might go up by 50% but your Lira's might actually go down 95% in value due to inflation and other factors like interest rates, trade balances etc.

This is why I laugh when people buy a token because it's native to a blockchain that they think is really good. A Blockchain being good doesn't automaticly mean it's token has more value. Bitcoin's blockchain is slow and old yet Bitcoin's market cap is 1,2 trillion.

The real meme coin winners and why retail is left holding the bags,"Meme coin season launched in full force these past couple of weeks attracting new users across multiple chains.

Some call it ultimate blockchain PVP, as it requires users to gamble on the meme token and flip it before other users (or Bots) dump the price 100%. 

BOME (BOOK OF MEME) made headlines as it hit $1B Marketcap in a day of launch, let's break down the top winners or ""traders.""

[To the insiders go the spoils](https://preview.redd.it/5pdljoz9wepc1.png?width=1205&format=png&auto=webp&s=10388a3cc8c4beed6b8e66f30561130afebb2b62)

Yep, the top 4 ""traders"" bought 0 BOME, but extracted $21M from retail. It's a great business being the creator of a massive popular Meme Coin. Now look at spots 5-6. These traders dropped $400k+ a piece on the token as the second layer of insiders and turned $4M plus each in profits.  No retail in sight. 

How do you get in early on a meme coin? You create it or be a close insider that is already rich or be an influencer on twitter that gets a free airdrop to pump n' dump on retail. Where does the first ""retail"" trader land (or the first trader to buy less than $10k)? Rank #68 with $8338 worth of BOME bought and sold for $872k

Well, what if you use screener tools and want to get in early? Here are some meme tokens created in the past hour

[Hint: they all go to zero, most dont last 30 minutes](https://preview.redd.it/7oas69o9xepc1.png?width=1561&format=png&auto=webp&s=ffd804e78612a704f5756be0e6375dae2dbe362f)

This is the other end of the spectrum from BOME. These are what I call the scalping meme coins that last 15m-1hr tops before the creator rugs the liquidity. The goal here is high action pvp, put $10 in and pull out for a quick $5-10 profit before the other guy rugs you.

SLERF is another popular memecoin atm with $400M market cap. No surprises to who the big winners are:

Another nefarious trend on Twitter is the notion of Pre-Sale, where users send their native token to an address listed in a tweet, hoping for a sweet airdrop. Millions of dollars have vanished to no surprise.

Help please!  Relatively new to Crypto - please be kind…,"I currently have coins sitting on Crypto.com and would like to move them to a cold wallet for safe keeping.  I have been researching how to transfer to Tangem and all of the videos make it look simple.  But my questions are these

1.  If I chose a chain when I originally purchased the crypto (having no idea at the time what it meant) do I have to use that same chain to transfer out?  Is it still sitting there?  Or will more options than that one pop up when I try to transfer out of Crypto.com? 

2.  I know I have to use the same chain on both ends of the transfer otherwise my money disappears.  How do I find out which chain my crypto is on before buying a cold wallet that may or may not support that chain?  I have seen nothing at all on any of Crypto.com’s FAQ’s or help pages to tell me where to find that info.  And trying to get someone in customer service is horrendous.

3.  Can any Crypto users explain to me how Crypto.com determines what you can sell?  I keep getting a maximum that is not nearly what I own.  What if I wanted to sell of my ETH for example?  Can they say no? 

4.  What are the opinions out there with Tangem?  It was recommended on YouTube by Crypto Casey, but I have no idea what the “gold standard” cold wallet is.

Is Koinly worth it (tax prep)?,"I finally finished preparing my taxes (USA). It kind of sucked. I used [tax.crypto.com](https://tax.crypto.com). This is nice in that 1.) it will actually produce the 8949 and schedule D form needed for the IRS, and 2.) it's free. Unfortunately it doesn't work super well. I used a couple CEXs this year and I also have half a dozen wallets or so. It didn't recognize the API data from one of my CEXs at all, and even after I uploaded the CSV records I still had to go through several hundred transactions to correct bad categorizations. 

Koinly looks nice and shiny but to produce tax documents you need to sign up for a plan and pay for it. Also, despite feeling like a relative newb, apparently my combined transaction numbers would require me to subscribe to the ""pro"" tier plan for $250 per year. Given that I actually made a good deal more than $250 off crypto last year, and I can only assume my crypto complexity is only going to increase from here, I'd be willing to pay for it if it actually works well.

I need help,"I’m only looking for advice and not looking for people to tell me how stupid I am because I never should’ve listened to that jackass four years ago. It worked the first time so I did it a second time and that’s when the system glitched and it’s been an ongoing nightmare for four years. After this, I’m done with crypto market, because my experience has been a terrible one.

The short version of the story is that I invested $125 in Vistamines four years ago. it was supposed to go into. I think it was 25% return category and instead it published into their 50%. I contacted them because the money wasn’t available on the date was supposed to be and that’s when they told me that I made a mistake when I know darn well I didn’t because I was extremely careful and had somebody walking me through it, so the correct button was selected. The mistake was on their end and they’ve argued with me for years that their system is infallible and can’t make them a mistake. 

Ever, since that time, the amount needed to “trigger“ the process has increased every time I make an attempt and then it got to where I would get right amount to trigger, but there was taxes that I had to pay out of pocket in order to get the money. Supposedly those taxes have been paid, but then there was a ROI which goes up every time I want to get the money out. Time and interest has a tidy sum available for withdrawal, but I cannot figure out how to get a withdrawal and the company lies to me every time I reach out to them. And yes, I consider purposely omitting information as lying. I checked and double check that the amount is correct and that will be enough, and there’s nothing else that I need to know about, and they always tell me no, and then I do it and then after the fact they come back with something that’s missing. If I email them and lay everything out, I get responses that are degrading and nasty. The response is always I need to do what I need to do, and when I tell them that I did what they told me to do. They claim that it’s still my fault because I didn’t know about this extra step that nobody told me about. 

When I ask what is the amount I need to get the withdrawal out and they give me a number and then I say is there anything else that I need to know about and they tell me no, then logically what I send should be enough to end this nightmare.

I’m looking for advice to figure out how to get my money out of this company, so I can close the account and never ever look in that direction again. They’re two answers are that wasn’t enough by the time it got to us due to fees and stuff and well, the ROI is higher now so it’s actually more which they didn’t tell me when I specifically asked how much exactly do I need to close this out completely?

Yes, I realise I probably should’ve just let the $125 go or even the $500 initially but here we are four in. 

Is there any legal recourse? Is there anywhere I can go or maybe somebody is willing to loan the money that they’re looking for and I can pay them back out of the profit? I live paycheck to paycheck and use my refund because the person I’ve been working with and their supervisor assured me that that would be enough but then come to find out today that supposedly the account is tied to Ethiopia and in order for it to be released. The ROI had gone up and I need an extra $1200 which I just don’t have. I need what’s in the account so I can pay off all of my monthly debts and then maybe take time off of work to go back to school to get a degree and something I’m passionate about.

MicroStrategy a good idea?,"Hey y’all.

I know it’s been mentioned on here before but I just wanted to ask the following question so that I could get some direct and clear responses. 

Would it be ok for me to buy MSTR instead of Bitcoin to achieve the same results?

I believe this would be beneficial for me as: 
- I am not looking to hold my own bitcoin to send/receive

- I am not educated or interested in transferring bitcoin to wallets and holding keys etc. 

- I can hold it in my brokerage account which has no fee’s and no minimum spend

There are no Bitcoin ETF’s available where I am located (UK) and I have seen that MSTR tracks Bitcoin’s price movements pretty closely.

Can you please let me know if this ok and if it is good method to move forward with. 

If anyone has any negatives to this vehicle of investment, I would like to read those comments too. I have read that Saylor has taken on large debt and that BTC-USD volatility is around 18% while MSTR is around 40%+? People have also mentioned in this sub that he is rapidly liquidating his shares.

I know that BTC has been at an ATH recently but I am young and understand that it is better to buy today than tomorrow.

is this a scam?!,"I haven't really been interested in crypto for a few years now, out of curiosity, I opened up my metamask wallet and discovered an imported wallet that has $2.4k+ of BNB.

Beginner's guide to Ethereum L2 (or how to save 99.9% in gas),"You may have heard a lot of talk about L2 these days and maybe you don't know what they are and are too afraid to ask or maybe you 'kinda' know what they are but not really sure how to use them.  People keep talking about crazy low fees and maybe you want to see how it works.

This guide will help you get started.

On edit: by beginner I don't really mean a crypto noob but rather someone who has been using Ethereum for years, has a hardware wallet, understands self custody, transactions, uniswap, metamask, etc but never used an L2.  For that person this is their beginner guide on switching to L2s.



# So what are L2?

L2 or Level 2 networks are a seperate blockchain which gains security from an L1 (in this case Ethereum) by passing information back to L1.  This provides a way to keep L2 validators honest and punish them for attempted bad actions.  In essence they are like a sidechain (i.e. Polygon) but with additional security.  In Polygon POS as unlikely as it is to happen if the validators of Polygon conspire against you to commit fraud there is nothing Ethereum can do.  It is an independent chain.  With L2 the rollups pushed up to Ethereum provide an irreversible canonical record and can be used to prove the fraud, reverse the fraudulent transactions, and financially damage those who engaged in the fraud.

L2 are also the future of scaling.  The Ethereum ecosystem today (not tomorrow or five years from now but today) using L2 can support at least 1,000 tps.  Every transaction made on L2 instead of L1 allows at least a 100x increase in throughput.  With further optimizations of rollups and refinements in the L1 a target of 10,000 tps is reasonable.  Once full danksharding is completed 100,000 tps are possible.

I am not going to go into the technical details of how and why as this post is already a small novel but I will do a deeper dive in another post.

# Wallet

You are going to need a cross chain wallet.  That is a single wallet that support Ethereum and Ethereum L2s (and optionally side chains and other compatible L1s).  In theory you have a lot of options but I am going to just say save yourself a lot of frustration and get Rabby.  Seriously night and day compared to metamask or ledger live (gag).

[https://rabby.io/](https://rabby.io/)

Rabby is open source and available as chrome extension, standalone desktop, and standalone mobile app versions.  If you have a hardware wallet device like ledger or trezor you can connect it to rabby.  Keys stay in the device, rabby is just the UI and a much better UI for dealing with L2.  One nice thing about rabby is it has an option to block metamask and redirect metamask requests to itself.  You can also turn this off and direct all requests back to metamask.  This means you can use it with dapps that don't support rabby natively by just clicking the metamask option in the dapp.

If you have a software wallet you can either create a new seed phrase for rabby as a trial run or import your existing seedphrase.  I know the later sounds scary so trial run it with a new seed phrase.  Remember never store seed phrase in any digital form. Analog (paper) offline form only.  

Honestly not sure why I farted about with metamask so long this is the next generation wallet for the future L2 driven world.  You can tell it was built to support L2 natively and not something hacked on as an afterthought.

Hard to list all the advantages of Rabby but here are just a few

* A unified cross chain token list.  It shows all your tokens across Ethereum and all L2s and uses little network icons on the token icons to make it clear.  If you want to see just one network you can click on the network icon and filter to just that network.  Unlike metamask it comes out of the box ready with every L2 that exists plus sidechains (polygon) plus every EVM compatible L1 (i.e. ada).
* Automatic switching between networks.  If you are on uniswap and switch from uniswap ethereum to uniswap Arbitrum the wallet will switch too.  This makes working across multiple networks a lot nicer.
* Easy way to block spam tokens/nfts from token views.
* Separates out all defi applications with summaries (i.e. everything you are lending at aave and everything you are borrowing).
* Support for whitelisting addresses and locking down transfers to only whitelisted addresses
* Ability to tag both sites and contracts as trusted or not.
* Provides various optional warnings on first used contracts, low trust contracts, and unknown contracts.
* Nice interface for revoking permissions and ability to batch revoke old permissions
* Create bookmarks of commonly used dapps and load the web page directly from the wallet.
* Transaction simulator to show you what executing a transaction will do before you do it

&#x200B;

Lots more honestly it is a great wallet and hands down the lowest friction most understandable way to get involved with L2.  Even if you aren't ready to switch to L2 it is a great wallet for Ethereum and you are L2 ready when you take the plunge.

# Centralized Exchange Onramps

If you are just interested in dipping your toe in to try things out before dealing with bridges honestly Centralized exchanges are the way to start.  Fees to get crypto into L2 are cheaper.  It works the same way as sending from your exchange account to your wallet except you pick the L2 as the network instead of Ethereum.  If you just want to try things out I recommend depositing $50 on one of the major exchanges and then withdrawing it as ETH to an L2.  Once on the L2 you can swap as you see fit.

I don't know the status of exchanges for non Americans but here are the big five in the US. I also included Polygon, BSC, and Solana withdraw fees for comparison. There is no L2 exchange support yet for common ERC-20 tokens such as WBTC, UNI, MKR, SUSHI, ZRX, MATIC, SHIB, PEPE, MKR, SNX.  Right now it is limited to ETH and stablecoins.

The prices are withdraw fees obviously deposits from L2 are free.  Prices converted to dollars for ease of comparison and for non-stablecoins will vary.  The ??.?? are for where a withdraw is available but I couldn't confirm a price it likely is similar to others at that exchange but didn't want to assume.  Crypto.com interface is just dogshit and I could only torture myself so long.

* E = Ethereum (I think you know this one)
* A = Arbitrum One (commonly just called Arbitrum)
* O = OP Mainnet (which has to be the dumbest/confusing name most people just call it 'Optimism')
* B = Base (L2 developed by team at coinbase)
* Z = zkSync Era (come on guys work on naming)

A couple things to note.  The first is that Arbitrum is the most widely supported.  Of the 5 major US exchanges 4 support Arbitrum, 4 support Optimism although sometimes with higher fees or less options, 2 support ZK Sync Era but only for ETH, only one supports Base.

The other thing to note is coinbase has impressively good fees for L2 withdraws.  Ethereum ranges from $0.01 to $0.29 and USDC is free.  Kraken and Crypto are way overcharging although still 80% less than Ethereum.   Kraken charging $12 for a zk sync era withdraw has to be a mistake.  Hey Kraken check your pricing.

# Which L2 to use?

Right now there are almost two dozen L2s and more projects being started up.

[https://l2beat.com/](https://l2beat.com/)

Four of the bigger ones right now are Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, and zKSync Era which are compared below.  


Transaction costs are going to vary depending on what transactions so I include fees for both a simple transfer of ETH between two addresses and a uniswap direct swap between two tokens. TVL from defilama is included to get an idea of defi activity on the chain.  Also included is ""TVL"" from l2beat but to avoid confusion I am going to call it ""TAV"" total asset value because having two different TVL is just confusing.  The TVL/TAV is useful to see how much stuff a chain has and thus the likelihood of finding assets to lend, borrow, or swap.  Note TAV includes ""idle"" assets while TVL is assets locked into defi protocols.  Average transactions per second over the last 7 days provides an indication of relative volume between chains.

**Ethereum (L1)**

    TAV: ~$720B ($450B ETH, $60B ERC-20 stablecoins, $210B non-stablecoin ERC-20 tokens)
    TVL: ~$46B
    dApps: 997
    tps: ~10 tps
    Eth transfer gas fee: ~$2.00
    Uniswap gas fee: ~$12.00

Pretty sure you know this one already.  Included for comparison.

&#x200B;

**Arbitrum** (officially ""Arbitrum One"")

    Technology:  Optimistic Rollup
    TAV: $16.2B
    TVL: $3.3B (20% of L1)
    dAPPS: 575 (58% of L1)
    tps: ~12 tps (120% of L1)
    Eth transfer gas fee: ~$0.03
    Uniswap gas fee: ~$0.09

The largest L2 by far in terms of TAV and TVL.  It now routinely has higher transaction volume than Ethereum.  It also boasts the largest CEX support and the most dapps.  If you don't know which chain to start on this is a solid first choice.  The transaction fees are slightly higher than other L2.  Not clear if this is due to demand or simply less optimization.  Fees are still >99% cheaper than Ethereum.  It has a TVL higher than any ""eth killer"" L1 chain.  Note the full name is actually Arbitrum One although some places will just call it Arbitrum.  There is a separate project Arbitrum Nova which is a ultra high speed low cost sidechain designed to niche applications where cost trumps security and decentralization. 

&#x200B;

**Optimism** (officially ""OP Mainnet"")

    Technology:  Optimistic Rollup
    TAV: $7.7B 
    TVL: $0.9B (6% of L1)
    dApps: 218 (22%  of L1)
    tps: ~6 tps (60%  of L1)
    Eth transfer gas fee: <$0.01
    Uniswap gas fee: <$0.01

Solidly the number two option.  Optimistic is behind Arbitrum so far in every metric except fees.  It impressively has very low fees even compared to other L2. A uniswap swap was <$0.01.  Routinely around 0.2 cents even for bridge or swap transactions. That is >99.98% cheaper than Ethereum.  You could do almost 5,000 swaps on Optimism for the cost of one swap on L1.

&#x200B;

**Base**

    Technology:  Optimistic Rollup
    TAV: $1.4B 
    TVL: $0.7B (4% of L1)
    dApps: 234 (23% of L1)
    tps: ~12 tps (120% of L1)
    Eth transfer gas fee: ~$0.01
    Uniswap gas fee: ~$0.01

The big claim to fame for base is it is supported by coinbase (base, coinbase get it).  Ties optimistic in low fees and has an impressive amount of dapps but only exchange supporting withdraws so far is coinbase.

&#x200B;

**zkSync Era**

    Technology:  zk Rollup
    TAV: $0.7B 
    TVL: $0.2B (1% of L1)
    dApps: 101 (10% of L1)
    tps: ~15 tps (150% of L1)
    Eth transfer gas fee: ~$0.01
    Uniswap gas fee: ~$0.04 (SyncSwap)

The only one of the big four using zk Rollups.  zk Rollups have a lot of long term potential but there are challenging making them EVM compatible and thus specific dapps may not currently be possible or require changes.  This has resulted in the lowest dapp numbers of the four and with it lower TVL/TAV.  Uniswap is not available but the comparable syncswap had $0.04 gas fee.  One advantage of zkRollups is when using the canonical bridge to move tokens back to L1 there is no delay.

# No seriously which L2 should I use?

**Right now if you haven't identified a specific need I would recommend Arbitrum as a first choice.**  The fees are slightly higher than other options (so 99% instead of 99.9% lower gas fees) but it has wide support in terms of tokens, dapps and exchange support.

# Bridges

Before messing about with bridges between L1 and L2 I strongly recommend getting setup with Rabby and transferring $20 to $50 of ETH from a CEX to an Arbitrum.  It is simpler and easier and you can get started very quickly with very little risk or stress.  However eventually you are likely going to want to move your ""stuff"" already on the L1 to an L2 in order to make future transactions cheaper.  

Your three options are:

**Use a CEX:** While not a bridge exactly using a CEX can be a lot cheaper.  As an example coinbase charges $0.01 to $0.29 for a withdraw to Arbitrum and deposits from the Ethereum network are obviously free.  This means a CEX can essentially be a low cost bridge.  Deposit your ETH/tokens to CEX from Ethereum network to the exchange's provided Ethereum address.  Once it clears then withdraw to your L2 address.

Pros: very cheap possibly free

Cons: limited to ETH and some stablecoins at this time

**Use a crosschain liquidity pool based bridge:** These work like uniswap liquidity pools but across chains.  They usually have a percentage fee in the 0.1% to 0.4% range and gas tends to be cheaper than canonical bridges.  If your token isn't available you will need to use a canonical bridge but worth checking out first.  Due to the % pricing if you have a large amount of assets (>$100k in a single token) it may be cheaper to use the canonical bridge.  Just like uniswap began with a few dozen tokens and exploded to thousands I expect the same will be true of liquidity bridges

Pros: more tokens supported, usually lower cost than canonical bridge if value is low

Cons: Limited by liquidity so may not be suitable for very large transactions

There are numerous bridges but three of the largest for supporting L2 are:

* Hop Protocol - [https://app.hop.exchange/](https://app.hop.exchange/)
* Rhino Finance - [https://app.rhino.fi/](https://app.rhino.fi/)
* Stargate - [https://stargate.finance/transfer](https://stargate.finance/transfer)

Hop Protocol is limited to ETH and stablecoins but tends to have fast performance and low gas fees.  It has some nice pools with token rewards for helping out.  The other two are more comprehensive supporting a large number of tokens and even supports bridging to sidechains and other L1s.

**Use the canonical bridge:** Every L2 has a bridge which is a part of the L2.  It is how assets become part of the L2.  Tokens are locked up on Ethereum and then an equal amount minted on the L2.  When bridging the other way the tokens on L2 are burned and then an equal amount unlocked on L2.

Pros: any ERC-20 token supported and exchanged at 1:1

Cons: usually the most expensive option due to L1 gas fees unless bridging a very high value ($100k+).

# How do I buy staking tokens and cold storage them on L2?

1. Deposit funds on a CEX which supports L2 withdraws
2. Once funds clear buy Eth
3. Withdraw to L2 of your choice (Arbitrum recommended)
4. Use a dapp like [https://curve.fi](https://curve.fi) to swap from ETH to STETH or WSTETH

# How do I trade shitcoins?

1. Deposit funds on a CEX which supports L2 withdraws
2. Once funds clear buy Eth
3. Withdraw to L2 of your choice (Arbitrum recommended)
4. Use a dapp like uniswap to swap ETH for shitcoins

Note: options may be limited but liquidity pools are building out on L2.  Check uniswap ahead of time so see if the token you are interested is available. Be sure to change uniswap network icon (upper right) to an L2.

# Do I need L2 tokens?

L2 tokens are only used for governance.  The gas on L2 is Eth just a lot less.  Your L2 wallet will need Eth to pay for gas so your first transfer should be Eth.  If you trap yourself Rabby wallet does have a gas fillup option. It comes with 20% fee ($20 of ETH for $24) but you can pay for it with any coin on another network.

# What about polygon?

Polygon POS (the chain you pay for gas with MATIC) is not an L2 it is a sidechain.  You can think of sidechains as a prototype version of L2.  As a sidechain polygon POS does not benefit form the security of Ethereum.  TVL/TAV for Polygon has been declining as people move funds to L2 which provide high tps and low fees but with the security of rollups to L1 (Ethereum).  Note if you currently have tokens on Polygon POS you may wish to just bridge them directly to an L2 instead of up to L1 and then to an L2.

# What is my address for L2?

That is the great part.  It is the same address as L1 (Ethereum) and the same on every L2.

# How do I pay for gas on an L2?
ETH is the gas for almost all L2.  So your first deposit/bridge/swap into an L2 should be ETH so now you have the gas you need.  Works just like Ethereum just 99.9% cheaper.  Right now gas prices on Arbitrum are 0.1 GWEI and on Optimism they are 0.0004 GWEI and on Ethereum they are 32 GWEI.

"MIcrostrategy thinks their loans are helping BTC. But actually the loans are likely insurance agreements for institutions shorting BTC for billions of dollars, at the expense of MSTR shareholders.","The loan terms are that if the BTC price goes up, then the loan can be converted into MSTR stock which is basically a form of BTC for an agreed upon price, basically similar to a call option.

If the price goes down then the loan is kept as dollars, and must be repaid at some point, including potentially liquidating all of MSTR BTC holdings for cash to repay the dollar loans.

The interest rate is nearly nothing.

So the question is who would spend hundreds of millions/billions buying these types of call options?

Companies actually bullish on BTC can just buy some or use the ETF/actual-futures. However its actually quite difficult to find a safe way to short BTC without the risk of unlimited upside.

MSTR comes along and solves this problem, he doesnt need to pay much interest since the terms of the loans are so bad for MSTR holders, that these shorters are more than happy to make it seem like they are lending money, but really are purchasing insurance for their massive shorts, at the expense of MSTR shareholders.

**TLDR:**

>1) Company shorts BTC for billions

>2) Company lends money to MSTR and receives a deal:

>A) BTC goes up, their loan is converted to BTC. 

>B) BTC goes down, the debt is dollars.

>3) MSTR shareholders

>A) BTC goes up, they make a little bit of money, but the rest goes to the lenders. 

>B) BTC goes down, the shareholders lose potentially everything.

Tips on how to keep as much money as possible with a big sale.," 

Hey everybody! I need some advice.

I'm about to sell maybe about 70k euros worth of crypto and convert to FIAT (euros). With these kinds of amounts, I realize that difference in fees can have a pretty massive impact, in the hundreds or even thousands.

I do have experience with crypto, currently holding all of it in a ledger, but I don't have enough technical knowledge regarding the really intricate stuff like slippage etc.

In order to keep as much money as possible, it seems like Binance is mathematically the best option for me, now I'm just wondering if there are any other things I should keep in mind.

I was planning on transferring everything from my ledger to binance, then execute a market order on a BTC-EUR pair and get the euros this way, from within their trading view.

Any recommendations or things to watch out for? Obviously a bit paranoid as this represents a lot of money for me.

We need more consumer-focused Web3 projects,"I was just at a Eth London over the weekend and met some really cool people with some really interesting projects. The only problem was that the vast majority of their projects were some form of infrastructure layer for cross-chain payment, still requiring a lot of knowledge of how web3 operates. There feels like this gaping niche that hasn’t been filled properly where we can help seamlessly integrate “web 3” solutions into the average user’s web application.

Out of all the people I met, only one had a solution that was designed to treat wallets as an added authentication mechanic for a web app.

We need to obscure wallets and crypto for a while, treating them as features that knowledgeable users can opt into during signup, rather than the minimum requirement for people to start interacting with our apps and, by extension, the blockchain.

This is sort of a rant, but seriously, apart from ThirdWeb, where are all the normal consumer focused projects at?

Just digital gold,"It occurred to me freshly this morning that this community (the including myself) doesn’t fully appreciate what “digital gold” means. 

First, I want to disclaim: I’m skeptical that bitcoin can do everything. I’m above-average versed in the potential of Bitcoin L2s and L3s. But, there’s almost no question to me that something like a Solana has an important place as a high TPS platform. So, alts aren’t exactly “****coins” to me. They are venture capital, and they will produce important things. 

The general consensus, I think, is that Bitcoin has or will have achieved the role of “digital gold”. I think that’s fair. I think we all know no one will be building games on Bitcoin, for example. That seems silly. And games are a big part of our economy. 

But, I don’t think we all appreciate what “digital gold” means. This is because gold itself hasn’t been used as the base layer of money properly in most all of our lifetimes. When gold was at its height, it was *the* measuring stick for *all* monetary value in the majority of the developed world. 

Let’s try to see what that means (just looking this up now):

Total market cap of the top three companies in the world right now equals ~8 trillion. Total market cap of gold by itself right now is ~14.5 trillion. Let’s call this the top3 to gold ratio, and it’s about 0.55:1

Here’s the current picture:

Microsoft 211.29b rev, 3.1T mcap  
Apple:   383b rev, 2.68 mcap
Nvidia: 26.97b rev  , 2.21 mcap
Avg: 621.26rev , 2.66mcap
Valuation ratio: mcap= 4.28x annual revenue 
Gold 2154 per ounce 
Top 3 companies market cap is equivalent to the value of 3.7 billion ounces of gold


Lets look at 1929:

Standard Oil: 1.52 million rev
General Motors: 1.5 million rev
Ford: 1.14 million 
Average: 1.39m rev (*4.28)= 5.95m mcap.
Gold in 1929: 20.67 per ounce
Top 3 companies market cap was equivalent to the value of 287,865 ounces of gold in 1929

So, in a sense gold has been devalued today compared to 1929.

There’s all kinds of problems with the above comparison. We didn’t use modern multiples for companies back then. Global markets mean top products *should* be worth more. (Although keep in mind I compared revenues, so this should be accounted for somewhat). Etc. 


But, the general point is that gold was more dominant in 1929 than it is today. When we say Bitcoin is digital gold, we should think about it closer to 1929 gold than modern gold. This means we’re underestimating how big that is. The measuring stick for *all* monetary value has a very large addressable market. 

I’m more sure that Bitcoin becomes gold than I am that Solana becomes Microsoft, for example. 

There are problems with that comparison too, I know. That’s less important. My bigger point is that we shouldn’t sleep on what digital gold means. 

What do you think?

What type of trader are you?," I know there are many types of traders in this subreddit, but which one are you? Any specific reason for choosing it? Have you considered to switch type?

 Before diving into the discussion, I think we should preview some of the basic types of traders:



1. **Day Traders**: These traders buy and sell financial instruments within the same trading day, aiming to profit from short-term price movements. They typically do not hold positions overnight.
2. **Swing Traders**: Swing traders hold positions for a few days to several weeks, aiming to capture short-to-medium-term trends or price swings. They may use technical analysis to identify entry and exit points.
3. **Position Traders**: Position traders take long-term positions in the market, holding onto their investments for weeks, months, or even years. They focus on fundamental analysis and broader market trends.
4. **Scalpers**: Scalpers aim to profit from small price movements by executing a large number of trades within a short period, often just seconds or minutes. They rely on quick execution and tight spreads.
5. **Algorithmic Traders (Algo Traders)**: Algorithmic traders use computer algorithms to execute trading strategies automatically. These algorithms may be based on technical indicators, statistical arbitrage, or other quantitative methods.
6. **High-Frequency Traders (HFTs)**: High-frequency traders use sophisticated algorithms to execute large numbers of trades at extremely high speeds, taking advantage of small price discrepancies. They often operate in highly liquid markets.
7. **Contrarian Traders**: Contrarian traders go against the prevailing market sentiment, buying when others are selling and vice versa. They believe that markets tend to overreact to news and events, creating opportunities for profit.
8. **Trend Followers**: Trend followers aim to profit from the continuation of existing market trends. They may use technical analysis to identify trends and follow them until signs of reversal appear.
9. **Event-Driven Traders**: Event-driven traders focus on specific events or catalysts that can impact market prices, such as earnings reports, economic data releases, or geopolitical events. They seek to capitalize on the price movements resulting from these events.



 Knowing what type of trader you are could help you review your performance better because you should at least know the benefits and downsides of your own approach:



1. **Day Traders**:

* Benefits: Can profit from short-term price movements, avoiding overnight exposure to market risks. Allows for quick decision-making and frequent trading opportunities.
* Downsides: Requires intense focus and discipline throughout the trading day. May incur higher transaction costs due to frequent trades.

1. **Swing Traders**:

* Benefits: Capture short-to-medium-term trends or price swings, potentially yielding higher profits than day trading. More flexibility in timing trades compared to day traders.
* Downsides: Positions may be held overnight, exposing traders to overnight market risks such as gaps in price. Requires patience to wait for optimal entry and exit points.

1. **Position Traders**:

* Benefits: Able to capitalize on long-term market trends and fundamentals. Less stressful than short-term trading styles, allowing for more relaxed decision-making.
* Downsides: Requires patience to wait for trends to develop and unfold over weeks, months, or even years. Positions may be subject to significant drawdowns during market fluctuations.

1. **Scalpers**:

* Benefits: Profit from small price movements with high-frequency trading, potentially generating consistent profits throughout the trading day. Minimal overnight exposure to market risks.
* Downsides: Requires advanced technology and low-latency trading infrastructure to execute trades quickly. High transaction costs due to frequent trading and tight spreads.

1. **Algorithmic Traders (Algo Traders)**:

* Benefits: Can execute trading strategies automatically, eliminating emotional biases and allowing for rapid execution of trades. Can analyze large amounts of data and adapt to changing market conditions.
* Downsides: Initial development and testing of algorithms require significant time and resources. Algorithms may malfunction or produce unexpected results, leading to losses.

1. **High-Frequency Traders (HFTs)**:

* Benefits: Profit from small price discrepancies with lightning-fast execution speeds. Can capitalize on short-lived market inefficiencies.
* Downsides: Requires substantial capital and sophisticated technology infrastructure. May face regulatory scrutiny and competition from other HFT firms.

1. **Contrarian Traders**:

* Benefits: Can capitalize on market reversals and overreactions, potentially generating profits when others are fearful or greedy. Provides a contrarian perspective that can lead to unique trading opportunities.
* Downsides: Requires strong conviction and patience to go against the prevailing market sentiment. Contrarian trades may take longer to materialize, leading to potential losses in the short term.

1. **Trend Followers**:

* Benefits: Able to profit from established market trends and momentum, riding trends until signs of reversal appear. Can generate consistent returns during trending markets.
* Downsides: May suffer losses during periods of market consolidation or trend reversals. Requires discipline to avoid entering trades against the prevailing trend prematurely.

**9. Event-Driven Traders**:

* Benefits: Can capitalize on market volatility and price movements resulting from specific events or catalysts. Provides opportunities for quick profits based on fundamental or news-driven analysis.
* Downsides: Requires accurate prediction and interpretation of event outcomes, which can be challenging. Event-driven trades may be subject to sudden reversals or unexpected market reactions.



 Why is it important to know which type of trader are you? This is crucial because you should trade with your suitable style. No one is alike, everyone has a different lifestyle. So you have to depend on your own time, work and social to determine which type will suit you best for your crypto journey.

 This will also help you improve your discipline to not being affected by your emotion and FOMO making a wrong decision.

Some examples:

* If you are a day trader, you will have to sit on your PC or laptop the whole day and watching chart, candle,...at any time throughout the day to gain profit. This lifestyle could be very stressful and take a lot of your time. You will need to do a lot to balance this style.
* If you are a position trader, you will have more free time but lesser control power on your crypto if you check back too late. I think this style is mostly like ""after some time of research and gaining private information, I believe this token will soon pump no matter what so I'm buying it and leave it there"".

 As you can see, these two trading styles are completely different from each other. Things will definitely go wrong if the position trader doesn't truly believe in his research and private information, and instead always watches the candles and charts like a day trader. His emotions will be controlled by what he sees, and he will start selling when the red candles keep appearing. However, after a few days, a couple of big green candles appear, and he starts regretting not believing in his own research and private information. He should have been more disciplined and left his crypto as it was, doing something else instead.

 Then again, I would love to hear your thoughts on which type of trader you are. Is there a specific reason for choosing that type? Have you considered switching types?

Selling my crypto in Canada and looking for help,"Hi there, I live in Canada and I have a few crypto I'd like to sell, 80% ETH, some XRP and a few others in small quantities like BTC, GLM, SHIB and EOS

Cryptocurrency is a failed social experiment,"EDIT: I am an idiot and was in a panic. Not my first time and probably won't be my last, but at least I didn't sell! Thanks to those who offered genuine advice and guidance! I'm going to leave this up because I might be a moron sometimes, but I'm not a b\*tch and know when to take an L. There is some good advice/info in the comments, so maybe others can also learn from my moment of stupidity!

We had a chance to break free from the banking system and we have failed. BlackRock, the US/Chinese government, and all those who support the traditional system have won. If we ever see an ATH again after this month, well..not going to promise anything because I don’t care anymore. But it’s not going to happen because we failed. Sure, some people will still make money, but I was hoping for true change.

I know I am going to receive unimaginable levels of hate from those who disagree, but yet again, I don't care. We had a chance to do something great and I'm watching it evaporate right in front of me. I don't even think it was a failure on the part of the community, this is just further proof the old system was too large and too corrupt to fail.

Even if we had managed to convince more people to accept crypto, how do you compete with companies like BlackRock who have more money than entire nations?? It was a rigged game and we were screwed from the start. They know what they missed out on before and they are not going to let ""regular folk"" disrupt the status quo.

Those if you who have been here from the start, I congratulate you on being the closest to financial independence probably anyone ever has been or will be since the dawn of ""credit"" and other BS concepts. I wish I could be a part of this change, stick it out and feel good about myself, but I am at least smart enough to have known that was never going to happen. Going to cash out my tiny bag, stave off homelessness a little longer, and be thankful for what I have for now. To those of you who keep fighting the good fight, good luck and thanks from everyone who has fallen long the way.

"Don't get shaken out by selling your coins on this correction, the upside of a bullrun far outweights the losses now","Red days like this are painful to see for almost all of us, especially newer crypto investors who just entered the space. The rest who endured last bearmarket probably are numb to this.

Many are shocked by seeing their coins falling in price and maybe start to sell their coins in order to maybe rebuy later.

It could be a good strategy if you're a very good trader, but the common joe like me am better off by holding. Why?

First, the bullrun hasnt started yet...there will be at some point.

Second: nobody can exactly sell at a local top and rebuy at the exact local bottom

Third: at some point the market will pump back hard, if one has sold at a loss to rebuy later, you might wait too long to rebuy and 'lost' the total digit amount of coins, when you decide to reenter the market

Ofc, all of this only applies to ""good"" coins that can recover. The way to play the crypto casino is to hold strong during bullmarkets and picking the right coins at the right time.

Sellers might see themselves rescued from a -40% loss, but they can risk a upside of +10000% pump when the market decides to come back.",CryptoCurrency,https://reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1biin5b/dont_get_shaken_out_by_selling_your_coins_on_this/,2024-03-19 08:06:26,0.09429339477726574,0.4218202764976959,0.075,0.11,0.8936

Opinions: How effective would a mining pool be if the resulting coins (through Unmineable) were sent to a burn address? ($SHIB),"I've been thinking about this for the past week as myself and two others set up our computers to mine about 25k SHIB to the burn address as a metric. Theoretically, this means that 30 people can bring 250k SHIB a week to the burn address, and 300 can do 2.5MIL. The constant growth and collective computing power can bring the hashrate and burn rate to new heights since it isn't computationally efficient to mine for a single address alone.

SHIB can't be mined, but through certain programs that specialize on unmineable coins, it will mine a coin then swap it for SHIB.  It's then reserved for an address on the ETH-20 network until the payout threshold is reached. 

I'm wondering if this can be as effective as I can imagine it to be. It would take determination and mass scaling to get it done. This is purely experimental at best, but can be effective with strength.

March 2024 Bitcoin option contracts - $8.3B+ on the table,"Bitcoin options are financial derivatives that grant the holder the right to buy or sell Bitcoin at a predetermined price (the strike price) on or before a specified expiration date. These contracts come in two flavors:

* Call Options: These give the holder the right to buy Bitcoin at the strike price. Traders use call options when they anticipate a price increase.
* Put Options: These allow the holder to sell Bitcoin at the strike price. Put options are useful for hedging against potential price declines.

The end of March 2024 marks a critical settlement date for Bitcoin option contracts when there's about $8.3B+ Open Interest in the market.

Looking at the current OI in deribit, it's interesting that there's a really significant # of call contracts (option to buy) placed at 60k, 65, and 70k levels. What is even more interesting is the fact that the max pain price is $50k. As a result, there's a clear incentive for MMs to push the price to this range to make those call contracts worthless.

Do you think this has anything to do with how the market perform recently?

The American Principles Act (APA) - legislation that pro-crypto legislators could support in response to the unAmerican sanctions on the decentralized Tornado Cash protocol,"This is a ChatGPT-assisted thought experiment on the kind of bill that pro-crypto legislators could support as an alternative strategy to the one currently being employed by US government agencies to counter North Korea's nefarious activity in the cryptocurrency space. This sets the US to target specific illicit activities directly, instead of imposing blanket sanctions that stifle innovation and infringe on privacy.

# The American Principles Act (APA)

**Objective:** To ensure the United States promotes innovation in the cryptocurrency sector, protects financial privacy, and effectively combats illicit finance without compromising foundational American values of freedom and privacy.

**Key Provisions:**

1. **Lifting of Sanctions on Decentralized Protocols:**
   * Immediately lift the sanctions on Tornado Cash and similar decentralized, open-source privacy protocols.
   * Affirm the U.S. Government's commitment to not prohibiting the use of decentralized protocols, recognizing their importance in ensuring financial privacy and freedom.
2. **Advanced Tracking and Analysis Initiatives:**
   * Allocate funding to the development of sophisticated tracking methods capable of de-anonymizing transactions on privacy-focused platforms when legally warranted.
   * Establish a framework for targeting and sanctioning specific addresses linked to illicit activities, such as those operated by hostile entities like North Korea, without infringing on the privacy rights of ordinary citizens.
3. **Strengthening Crypto Infrastructure Against Misuse:**
   * Allocate funding and resources for the research and development of secure, resilient cryptographic protocols that are resistant to theft, fraud, and misuse.
   * Encourage public-private partnerships to enhance the security and integrity of the crypto ecosystem, thereby reducing the attractiveness of crypto assets to criminals and hostile nation-states.
4. **Regulatory Clarity and Support for Innovation:**
   * Direct regulatory bodies to provide clear, supportive guidance and regulations that foster innovation and growth within the crypto industry, ensuring the U.S. remains a global leader in digital finance.
   * Promote an environment where privacy-enhancing technologies can flourish, balancing the need for security with the protection of individual freedoms.
5. **International Cooperation and Leadership:**
   * Lead international efforts to establish a balanced, effective approach to regulating cryptocurrencies, emphasizing the importance of privacy, innovation, and security.
   * Work with allies and international bodies to counter the misuse of cryptocurrencies by rogue states and criminal actors, while upholding the principles of freedom and privacy on a global scale.",CryptoCurrency,https://reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1bibfl0/the_american_principles_act_apa_legislation_that/,2024-03-19 00:07:00,0.1140625,0.36197916666666674,0.042,0.233,0.9975

While it's very encouraging to see crypto advocates being politically engaged, I think that sadly, the Democrats may be a lost cause, because they are too committed to the idea that government control over private economic interactions is a good thing. Good from the perspective of tax enforcement, and good from the perspective of crime prevention.

Given their political ideology, it's not surprising that the consensus view amongst those who work in financial crimes enforcement, and their overseers in the US Department of Justice, is that financial privacy is a right that must be sacrificed in the fight against bad actors.

This is an inherently fascist perspective that rationalizes warrantless mass-surveillance through extremely heavy handed government measures going as far as banning software and imprisoning open source developers, and the future of not just crypto, but of a free society, depends on defeating these ideas in the court of public opinion.

Unfortunately, the Democrats, in being stalwart supporters of so-called AML/KYC laws, have fully committed to this mass-surveillance/anti-privacy track.

Ethereum is a fork in the road. With it, open source software allows complete financial privacy and circumvention of all restrictions on financial interaction imposed by centralized authorities.

So either authorities respect the principles of liberal democracy and accept that the old ways have to be abandoned as freedom in finance becomes the status quo, or they have to clamp down on Freedom of Speech and restrict what kinds of open source software can be created.

The Biden DoJ chose the latter by indicting Tornado Cash's open source developers.",CryptoCurrency,https://reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1bi9jcj/the_democratic_administration_in_the_us_has_for/,2024-03-18 22:31:37,0.08587273293155645,0.4051042639277933,0.071,0.132,0.988

Most accurate crypto aggregator/portfolio/tax service?,"Hi all,

I am new to crypto and I am trying to be proactive about organizing my assets/transactions for tax purposes. I have tried a couple of different services (namely CoinStats, CoinLedger, Koinly, CoinTracker, CoinGecko) all with wildly different results in terms of the capital gains, cost basis, portfolio growth, etc.

&#x200B;

It is a bit of a pain to go through the process of categorically entering all of my wallets into these platforms just to find that my returns are completely inaccurate and unreliable. I am honestly having a hard time even keeping track of what my profits have been outside of a very basic spreadsheet that I manually update. 

&#x200B;

I like CoinStats the most, but I know it's not fully set up for tax reports. I feel like Koinly is the closest so far in terms of accuracy, but CoinLedger has the easiest integration of all of my wallets.

# Solana's TVL problem

Solana contracts return FAIL errors on *50% to 80%* of all current transactions. You experience them as order delays and frustration. See for yourself at [solanabeach.io](https://solanabeach.io)

The Cause: **Low TVL + Dry liquidity = Big slippage problems**

On Monday 3/18, SOL Dex Volume totaled $2.8B vs Ethereum's $2.0 Billion. With better liquidity, this would be good news. But Solana's poor liquidity stores are like running a cash-based market but having hardly any cash of your own for smooth transactions.

Poor liquidity spikes volatility and produces transaction errors. Even small swaps impact price and affects slippage. Users who operate front-running bots manipulate these conditions to your detriment. You end up waiting longer than necessary. When your TXN finalizes, you've likely paid more and/or earned less.

Solana strives to outperform Ethereum, but with only access to the equivalent of 8% of Ethereum's liquidity by contrast.

This liability remains anchored to Solana for at least another year. The unlocks are over and above scheduled inflation. It bears mentioning this 10% is now reduced to 8.2%. Money continues to *leak* from a number of mystery wallets.

>***Solana's annual inflation rate is currently 5.515% and will decrease by 15% every year.***

That statement is only true if you agree that one year DOES NOT need to equal 365 days.

See the green highlighted section above. The inflation schedule is denominated in epoch years. What's an epoch year?

* 1 epoch = 2.5+ days
* 180 epochs = 1 Epoch Year
* 1 Epoch Year spans 450 to 630 Earth days (dependent on the length of each epoch).

Epoch years offer wide margin to adjust the numbers. Its technically not a lie. That leads you to the truth at the end: ***Actual inflation rate will vary.***

Its equally important to consider that inflation is the effective circulating supply. Everything that's out there! But the Solana Foundation only factors new SOL issuance used to pay validators. That's misleading, if not deceptive.

50% fees burned and remaining 50% paid to validators.

The network stays afloat by rewarding SOL holders 5.01% for maintaining SOL on the network. That 5% is printed daily. The resultant inflation hits non-stakers entirely. The award payment shields validators and stakers from inflation. The small percentage gap between🟩&🟥 is covered by🟪.

Non-stakers pay stakers and cover network expenses. Its no different than the Government paying debts by printing money. We only get the inflationary effect. Same happens to Sol non-stakers.

I kindly thank you if you read this far. That was Solana tokenomics in a nutshell.

Value of Bitcoin held on exchanges in $USD,"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9lhz1o4knzoc1.png?width=1396&format=png&auto=webp&s=394a6a6fbeaf4f3ef1a72466280a834f9728e5ab

Observations: 

1. $USD value of bitcoin held on exchanges has increased approximately +114% over the past year. 
2. Since ETFs were approved $USD value on exchanges increased +48%
3. Quantity held on exchanges decreased by 11% over the past year
4. Quantity held on exchanges decreased by \~4% since ETFs were approved (-81K bitcoin)

ETFs have acquired a net of 216K bitcoin so far. That 216K has only decreased quantity on exchanges by 81K. Possibly retail is taking profits, possibly people transfering bitcoin holdings to ETFs, possibly ETFs getting filled some other way. 

$USD value of bitcoin held on exchanges peaked at $180 B during the peak in November 2021. This trend of increasing $USD value held on exchanges goes against the supply crunch narrative. At current prices the halving will decrease new supply by $31 M per day, or  .023 % of exchange held supply per day.

Seven beginner questions I need help with,"Hello, I am a beginner in cryptocurrency and after some research I have seven questions I would very much appreciate your help with. I wish to buy, store, trade and exchange some to fiat. I plan to stay off CEXs as much as possible, but there seem to be some difficulties with that.

1. I found that you can use an app like *bisq* to buy *BTC* for example, how good of an option is that and do you recommend any other? As there is a decent fee to *BTC* transactions, what is the minimum amount you would recommend buying at once? Another point is, buying on CEXs, don't you pay the fee twice if you chose to withdraw to your wallet afterwards?
2. If you are trading, I assume you keep some coins on a hot wallet and use a DEX to trade? Afterwards, you can choose to withdraw back offline? Keep in cold, put in hot while trading?
3. If buying small amounts would you recommend buying *WBTC* to save on transactions? Personally I feel against it if I was going to store and hold long-term, I guess for trading it could work?
4. If a cold wallet supports a certain network, does that mean you can store there newly created tokens built on the same network as well or no? I would assume a software that the wallet runs on would need to be updated with the new tokens first?
5. I am going to receive some USDT TRC20, which hot wallets would you recommend for that?
6. Best way to exchange to fiat? How about finding a local provider over using CEX > bank?
7. How do you go about exchanging coins from different networks? I guess this would be similar to question 1 since you could get BTC that way as well if it were possible. Is there any sort of a DEX that can do this? Or at least some sort of a centralized exchange to which I can connect my wallet and use their trading services only?

You don't know me and have no obligation to spend your time reading this and helping me out, so I very much appreciate if you do choose to do so!

Bitcon's Early Origins and Satoshi Nakamoto,"As we approach the fourth halving of Bitcoin, the Bitcoin community has changed and evolved a lot since its inception. It's worth revisiting the early community that formed around Bitcoin. 

This article looks at many recent documents released, and pieces together facts about Satoshi Nakamoto and who he might be.   


Evidence examined:

 \- new emails released by Martti Malmi

 \- new emails released in Craig Wright's trial

 \- early internet posts by Satoshi

&#x200B;

Candidates:

Dorian Nakamoto:

* Shares the name ""Satoshi Nakamoto"", which led to him being misidentified initially.
* However, his background in physics and defense projects doesn't align with the skillset required for developing Bitcoin.

Nick Szabo:

* Created the precursor ""Bit Gold"" digital currency and has a background in computer science, cryptography, and law, making him a plausible candidate.
* However, his views on Bitcoin differ from Satoshi's, and he has denied involvement.

Gavin Andresen:

* Was chosen by Satoshi to take over the Bitcoin project and had direct communication with him.
* However, he claims to have learned about Bitcoin in 2010, which would be after its initial creation.

Hal Finney:

* Was the first person to receive a Bitcoin transaction from Satoshi and was deeply involved in the cypherpunk community.
* His background in computer science and interest in extropianism align with Satoshi's profile.

Craig Wright:

* Has claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto multiple times, but his claims are widely disputed within the community.
* While he has a relevant background in computer science and security, he has not provided conclusive proof of being Satoshi.

Adam Back:

* Was one of the first to receive emails from Satoshi and has a deep understanding of Bitcoin's architecture.
* His background in cryptography and digital currencies like Hashcash make him a strong candidate.

Len Sassaman:

* Was involved in early remailer technology, which is seen as a precursor to Bitcoin's peer-to-peer architecture.
* His obituary is embedded in Bitcoin's code, suggesting a close connection to Satoshi.

Ian Grigg:

* Developed concepts like Ricardian contracts and triple-entry accounting systems, which were later used in Bitcoin.
* However, he has denied being Satoshi, although he may have been part of the team behind it.  


Satoshi might not be a single person, but a few people who at different times took on the pseudonym.

Need advice for smart contract data collection,"Hi, I work as a data scientist and I am seeking advice for my research. I am running a project to find malicious smart contract addresses. My goal is to create machine learning models to predict the risk that each smart contract has. In order to achieve this, I need to collect as many malicious smart contract addresses as possible, and label them with risk tags. 

&#x200B;

**The steps I planned:**

1. Access web3 auditing websites such as Hacken, OpenZeppelin, Consensys Diligence, Kudelski Security, ChainSecurity halborn.com etc.
2. These websites have blog posts about web3 security incidents as well as trusted web3 projects. From those articles and papers, collect smart contract addresses. Target chains are Ethereum, Arbitrum, polygon and Optimism.
3. Together with addresses, gather risk information associated with each address. Especially if the smart contract address is a malicious one, pay close attention to the articles and papers and gather risk information.
4. For each address and associated risk information collected, put risk tags. Risk tags are a collection of dozens of pre-defined true/false labels. Examples of the risk tags in the list are: “*honeypot*”, “*Slippage Modifiable*”, “*Airdrop Scam*”.

&#x200B;

**Example:**   
Let’s visit hacken.io, a web3 auditing company. They have a lot of blog posts about security incidents. In [this entry](https://hacken.io/insights/kyberswap-hack-explained/), they explain some notable examples of smart contract hacks. 

Down in the middle, under the section ""**The Flaw: Reentrancy in the Mint Function**"", you can find:

Clicking the link above leads you to [a page](https://etherscan.io/token/0xcbec1e9407f1910c86f261eaeac27d85c0479e8c) in Etherscan.io. Down in the middle, there’s a link to a [contract page](https://etherscan.io/address/0xcbec1e9407f1910c86f261eaeac27d85c0479e8c).

Copy the contract address(*0xcbEc1e9407F1910c86F261eAeaC27d85c0479E8c*) and put it in the spreadsheet. Set “*Reentrancy*” risk tag to “*true*”.

&#x200B;

**Ask:**

I want to get advice on 

* If this is a feasible project. I am aiming to collect 20,000 smart contract addresses as well as risk tags. So it’s gonna be either to outsource this project to many freelancers, or seek a way to automate it with a script.
* I am counting on reports published by web3 auditing websites listed above. However I’m not sure if they have enough information. Is there any better way to collect addresses?

Big Block Debate. BCH is superior. ,"What am I missing? Big blocks seem to be better than small blocks in almost every way. Faster and cheaper transactions. It makes bitcoin scalable. I am trying to find reasons why bitcoin cash isn’t better than bitcoin. 

I understand that the concern with big blocks is that it will make the chain grow faster, because there will be more transactions, which will require more storage space for miners and nodes. But storage is getting cheaper and cheaper by the year. It also is much cheaper than running a mining rig, so it certainly is not the “pinch point” for decentralization. 

I have been reading up on this history of the block wars and it is very odd to me that the small blockers won. Satoshis helper, Gavin Andresen was a big blocker, and there were many people supporting him. The big resistance was from blockstream and their developers. Their only reason for resistance was that it would lead to centralization. 

Interesting to see where we are today. No one is spending their bitcoin, a layer two is struggling to gain traction and the concentration of bitcoin wealth is falling into a small amount of hands. Exchanges, ETFs and large corporations are gobbling up bitcoin at an alarming rate. 

Bitcoin cash is looking more and more appealing to me. Bigger blocks, less concentrated, still decentralized and working as satoshi would have hoped. After all, peer to peer cash is in the title of the white paper. 

Would love to hear everyone’s thoughts. It has been a while since I have hear the crypto community debate about block sizes.

Realised today that I don't like where Ethereum is going,"Background :

I only hold BTC and ETH (70%/30%).  
I've been around in the crypto space for a very long time.  
The following is my own opinion and this a this a friendly discussion about ETH only. I'm not looking for alternatives, I already know most of them.

Lately, I've been really considering swaping my ETH for BTC (at least for now) for the following reasons:

* Ethereum team pretty much completely gave up on scaling the main chain. they are now solely focused on improving L2s and pushing people toward using them.
* I think L2 suck, and that they're not user friendly. some people might argue that bridging tokens is ""easy"", but I think you're missing other important points : 1- whenever i want to get paid in ETH from a business or someone, NO ONE EVER has a withdraw/payment with L2s. same goes with sending money to normal people. 2- This is pretty much how L2 feels to for anyone I've ever talked to : Risky / Complicated / afraid coins will be lost (multiple chains and names confusing) / afraid to use a malicious site / Fuck this, I rather just use another cheap L1 chain.
* This is how I see BTC/ETH : -I hold BTC because i believe it's the best store of value (like gold) -I hold ETH because i believe it's a cheaper way to move money, while also being safe store of value that's not gonna dump and die in the future. The thing is now, I'm starting to believe that Ethereum lost the position as a cheap L1 chain and it's never getting it back because they don't care about cheap L1 anymore. (like how Vitalik's gas limit proposition got ignored and sharding on L1 not being a priority anymore). Your bags aside, how can you possibly think that most people will be using L2s in the future, when you can clearly see that people are having a hard time just wrapping their head around basic crypto stuff ? I just can't see it.

**UPDATE** : Thank you all for your answers and ideas. I came now to realization that it is unreasonable to expect ETH to achieve low fees on L1, while at the same time keeping the same level of decentralization and security. I still believe L2 as it stands is not user friendly enough. and thanks to u/kumomax1911 comment, I know now that there is ongoing work to make L2 more seamless experience without the need for bridging (still need to search more about it) .

Exit-ability Without Reliance on Market,"One compelling reason to invest in De-fi is that it allows individuals to maintain control over their own assets, a stark departure from Trad-Fi institutions like banks. While some projects in this space still emulate traditional finance practices, others, like Reserve Protocol’s RTokens, propose an entirely different approach.  

RTokens, created by Reserve, are designed to combat inflation and promote decentralization, by minimizing reliance on fiat currency and shielding against governments and banks fiscal policies. With 8 types of Rtokens currently available to the public, the variations in backed assets and the purpose of each RToken may make them appear distinct from one another. Nonetheless, one consistent feature persists: the 24/7 self-redeemability.

As mentioned earlier, RTokens provide a distinctive advantage for investors, as they possess the ability to self-redeem their RTokens back to their original assets at any given time, without any requirement for approval from Reserve Protocol. This empowers holders to redeem their investments (assets) without limitations, rendering stop-loss concerns a non-issue. In my opinion, this represents a significant advantage over other investment options and even in the DeFi realm, many other protocols have yet to offer such guarantees and flexibility.

To give a more clear example, in the event of a widespread redemption of assets, loss of confidence in RTokens, or even a general crisis affecting stablecoins, RToken holders maintain the autonomy to initiate the redemption process without any interference from Reserve Protocol or the governing body of each RToken. This means that if you decide to exit, you can do so at your own discretion, regardless of the potential impact on the market. I’d say with this feature alone, it justifies considering an investment in RTokens.",CryptoCurrency,https://reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1bho8i3/exitability_without_reliance_on_market/,2024-03-18 07:16:33,0.17727272727272728,0.5375,0.035,0.136,0.9709
"Millions flow into Solana memecoin presales within 72 hours, raising scam concerns.","Founders of Solana's SOL have made millions through token presales in the last 72 hours, and traders have bought about $100 million worth of new Solana memecoins. Because these presales don't guarantee token delivery, there is a risk of scams. Tokens like Book of Meme (BOME) increased by more than 36,000% to a $1.45 billion market capitalization in spite of skeptics. Due to their exceptional profits, early investors came under fire from financial professionals such as Anthony Sassano for making riskier investments. It is advisable to exercise caution as the memecoin mania continues because of doubts regarding its legality and longevity. Investors should study the industry carefully and weigh the dangers involved in the extremely erratic cryptocurrency market.

Bull market is more stressing to me than bear market,"Past few weeks have been very stressful. I suck so bad at investing and rotating money. I was 50% invested in KAS in November, made 2 - 3x atATH peak and still holding it and it has not done anything while many AI and Memes have given up 5 - 10x easy gains. 

Previous NFTs bubble made me way too conservative investor. Yes AI is the future but I still think majority of them are vaporwares or are reselling services and because of this thought I did not rotate money in AI heavily as I should of have done. 

SOL have been the best runner up coin in top caps, and AVAX has been doing quite good lately following the SOL hype, but guess what I did not rotate into AVAX either. 

My 2 big bags are KAS,  INJ and AKT currently and after the recent Bitcoin dump to $65k, KAS and INJ still are red in the market while all other coins are in green and some of them up 20%, SOL entered top 4, and avax broke $60 

I'm just way exhausted and feel like shit. Money is not moving into coins I have invested in, but every other coin. 

Today is the Nvidia's conference, don't even know whether it will be sell the event for AI coins or buy the news but I wanna get into AI 

I have not even mentioned how other small investedments have played out for me which have made me even more fearful investor, basically whatever the f I invest in goes sideways or down ",CryptoCurrency,https://reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1bhmxvo/bull_market_is_more_stressing_to_me_than_bear/,2024-03-18 05:54:53,0.012003968253968258,0.40376984126984133,0.098,0.09,0.0

* Continue to HODL in self-custodial wallets
* Mix of all of the above.

Here’s what we’ve heard from others:

* There’s no question that they can provide tax benefits
* They're cheap to buy and sell, but require paying a management fee (generally 10-25 basis points in the long-term).
* While they reflect exposure to the price of Bitcoin, it’s not the actual Bitcoin.

"Too many reasonable and ""responsible"" posts","I've been reading too many responsible posts here. Let me explain to you what I mean. 

Many posts speak about how we're already made from 15K to 73K, speaking how this is out-of-mind returns and how the bull run could be close to the end and how ""this time will be different"".

\- In every single bull we have well passed the previous ATH, **giving insane gains who people who bought in the last cycle ATH's, which is not the case yet**. And many of you are assuming that the bull run could be close to over. 

\- Many, speak that this time people have learned and **they won't get burned by ALTS as they did in the last cycle.** Let me laugh at that stupidity, if something history has taught us is that people never learn, mistakes will be the same. **Do you want me to believe that greed won't be a major player in this cycle?** Now people shocked because of the meme coins ....seriously? some old, same old  It's been always like that.  (greed, greed, greed).

\- There will be the ones who will take seriously your responsible messages, **will sell now and then with the big dildos will buy again at a higher pric**e. That's a classic (BTC will get 100K and then we will learn whatever new and the next headlines will be that BTC is going for 1 mill and a 10X is still possible). 

\- After the very long bear that we came from, who according to this sub would not finished 6 months later that it finally started, you expect the bull to finish that quickly, **we have not seen any big event, no big corrections, no people going to sleep and wake up being millionaires, and read that in the news.**

**- ETF** , **brand-new** toy in crypto just debuting with **halving around the corner**, but it's over right? the music is starting to fade right? (LOL)

Honestly, I don't know if people who were here previous bulls are still afraid of the bear and are still in disbelief who forgot the feeling of what a crypto bull run is. 

I don't know about you. But prices for building materials (homes) and food skyrocketed last 2 years. I've been DCA the whole bear too, and do you really think this is over because we have already reached the previous ATH, after 2 years of aberrant inflation, after which our fiat money depreciated insanely? LOL 

**The ones posting the reasonable pots are parrots repeating what they read in the last bull run peak without having lived one? It seems so to me.**

***The full blog post with all the tables is*** [***here***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-50)***.***

Welcome to the monthly recap for the 3rd of 7 homemade Top Ten Crypto Index Funds. The 2020 Portfolio is made up of: **Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Tether, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, EOS, Binance Coin, BitcoinSV,** and **Tezos.**

**tl;dr:**

* **What's this all about?** I purchased $100 of each of Top 10 Cryptos in Jan. 2018, haven't sold or traded, reporting monthly. Did the same in 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and again in 2024. ***Learn more about the Experiment history, rules, and FAQs (including the answer to the ""WHY TETHER?!?!"" question)*** [***here***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/)***.***
* All green month, **BCH** and **ETH** win February. Overall leader is **BNB** followed by **Ethereum. BTC** is a distant third.

## Month Fifty – UP 658%

https://preview.redd.it/s557vkruu0pc1.png?width=1087&format=png&auto=webp&s=e9c90c731ad737f196f546bb55c4056683ab1e4e

The 2020 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund consists of: **BTC, ETH, XRP, USDT, BCH, Litecoin, EOS, BNB, BSV,** and **Tezos**.  

February highlights for the 2020 Top Ten Portfolio: 

* All green month
* **BNB** is in the overall lead, followed by **ETH**

## February Ranking and Dropout Report

https://preview.redd.it/x005ww5wu0pc1.png?width=367&format=png&auto=webp&s=a4b111ac8152dcc6e94241a7ceb7a2219e9121dc

**Top Ten dropouts since January 2020:**  after fifty months, half of the cryptos that [started in the Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-ten-month-one/) have dropped out:  **EOS**, **BSV, Tezos, Litecoin,** and **Bitcoin Cash** have been replaced by **Cardano,** **DOGE, SHIB, SOL,** and **USDC.**

At #85, **EOS** has sunk the lowest since January 2020.

## February Winners and Losers 

***February Winners*** – **BCH** (+75%) and **ETH** (+53%) were the best performers in the 2020 Top Ten Portfolio this month.

***February Losers*** – No coin really lost this month, but **XRP** underperformed, returning “only” +28% in February.

## Overall Update – BNB remains in first place, followed by second place ETH gains ground. Nine cryptos at break even or positive territory. 2020 Top Ten is the best performing Portfolio.

At +658%, the 2020 Top Ten Portfolio continues to be the best performing of the seven [Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/). 90% of the 2020 cryptos are in positive or break-even territory, **EOS** the lone exception.

**Binance Coin** continues to hold a significant lead, with **ETH** in a strong second place. The rest are significantly behind.

The initial $100 investment fifty months ago into first place **Binance Coin**? Currently worth **$2,944**, an increase of +2,844%.    

In second place is **Ethereum,** up +2,580%.

**EOS** is the worst performer in the 2020 group, down -60% since January 2020.   

## Total Market Cap for the Entire Cryptocurrency Sector:

https://preview.redd.it/i95dpo6yu0pc1.png?width=1164&format=png&auto=webp&s=61f2b9edbe48587232353fe22e0be7246aec1d6e

As a sector, crypto is up **+1133%** over the fifty month lifespan of the 2020 Top Ten Experiment.

There was no easy way to do it at the time, but if you were able to capture the entire crypto market since [January 2020](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-ten-month-one/) (+1130%), you’d be doing quite a bit better than the Experiment’s Top Ten approach (+658%) and ridiculously better than the S&P (+59%) over the same time period.  Much more on the S&P below. 

Crypto Market Cap Low Point in the 2020 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: [**$185B in March 2020** **(aka Zombie Apocalypse).**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-3) 

Crypto Market Cap High Point in the 2020 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment:  [**$2.6T in October 2021**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-22).

## Bitcoin Dominance:

**BitDom** ended February at 52.4% and has seen a steady rise over the last few months.

Here are the high and low points of **BTC** domination since the beginning of the 2020 Experiment:

Low Point in the 2020 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: [**38.1% in November 2022**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-35).

High Point in the 2020 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: [**70.4% in December 2020**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-1-year-report/).

## Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2020:

https://preview.redd.it/vzz0f6p0v0pc1.png?width=304&format=png&auto=webp&s=c1cbeff1d87a1647064c1c4a4664a527f2e26477

The 2020 Top Ten Portfolio is now worth **$7,579** (+658%) from the initial $1k investment.  

The 2020 Portfolio remains the best performing of [the seven Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/). 

Below is a month by month ROI of the 2020 Top Ten Experiment, to give you a sense of perspective and provide an overview as we go along: 

https://preview.redd.it/kqynxd22v0pc1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=12ad1095068aa7d35adb10a977e60e3c2c04705e

## Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios 

So what about combining seven years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?

* 2018 Top Ten Experiment: up +21% (total value $1,210)
* 2019 Top Ten Experiment: up +510% (total value $6,098)
* [2020 Top Ten Experiment:](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-50) up +658% (total value $7,579) (***best performing portfolio****)*
* 2021 Top Ten Experiment: up +200% (total value $2,997)
* 2022 Top Ten Experiment: down -41% (total value $588) (***worst performing portfolio****)*
* 2023 Top Ten Experiment: up +111% (total value $2,111)
* [2024 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-2): down +21% (total value $1,207)

Taking the seven portfolios together:

**After a $7,000 total investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$21,790.** 

**That’s up +211%** on the combined portfolios.  The peak  for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiment Portfolios was [**November 2021’s all time high**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11/) of **+533%**.  

Lost in the numbers? Here’s a graph to help visualize the progress of the combined portfolios:

https://preview.redd.it/qwoh5xl8v0pc1.png?width=1098&format=png&auto=webp&s=68b461efd773c3d07b403deb2ca7f263da31fcec

In summary: ***That’s a +211% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for seven straight years***.

## Comparison to S&P 500

I’m also tracking the S&P 500 as part of my experiment to have a comparison point with traditional markets.

https://preview.redd.it/38hrk0cav0pc1.png?width=1008&format=png&auto=webp&s=408c000e372f7e1659cbd4f1aac89daed3a60c32

Since the S&P 500 has returned +59% since January 1st, 2020, that same [$1k I put into crypto](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-ten-month-one/) in January 2020 would be worth $1,590 had it been redirected to the S&P 500 instead. 

Crypto over the same time period? The 2020 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio is returning **+658%**, worth **$7,579.**

**That’s a difference of $5,989 on a $1k investment.**

But that’s just 2020. What about other entry points? What if I invested in the S&P 500 the same way I did during the first seven years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments since January 1st, 2018, what I like to call the world’s slowest dollar cost averaging method?  Here are the figures:

* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $1,920 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $2,050 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,590 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,370 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $1,080 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,340 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2024 = $1,080 today

Taken together, the results for a similar approach with the S&P: 

**After seven $1,000 investments into an S&P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 my portfolio would be worth $10,430.**

That is up **+49%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+211%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.  

To help provide perspective, here’s a look at the combined five year ROI for crypto vs. the S&P up to this point.

https://preview.redd.it/bk14kjibv0pc1.png?width=1256&format=png&auto=webp&s=00a34ed60b18e4883162b696e076d28349c9c435

## Conclusion:

For those who have supported the Experiments over the years, thank you.  For those just getting into crypto, I hope these monthly reports can somehow help with perspective as you embark on your crypto adventures.  Buckle up, think long term, don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose, and most importantly, try to enjoy the ride.

A reporting note: I’ll focus on [2024 Top Ten Portfolio](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2024-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-2) reports + one other portfolio on a rotating basis this year, so expect two reports per month.  February’s extended report covers the one you’re reading here, the [2020 Top Ten Portfolio](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-44).

(Giveaway) 150 Lucky winners will be part of CC History and be among the first people to ever receive Moons on Arbitrum One and will forever be among the first transactions on the Arbitrum One Moon Contract.,"**Would you like to:**

* **Be one of the first people holding Moons on Arbitrum One?**
* **Have your Eth address be included in one of the first transactions on the Arbitrum One Moon Contract?**

**As the transactions on the contract are indefinitely stored on the blockchain, your ETH Address could forever be enshrined among the first transactions on the Arbitrum One Moon Contract.**

\---------------------

For those that don't know the Moon Contract on Arbitrum One already exists. It was brought into existence when 400K Moons were transferred on the Arbitrum Bridge from Nova to Mainnet Eth and then Mainnet to Arbitrum One. (A seven day journey)

The contract can be found here:

* [https://arbiscan.io/token/0x24404dc041d74cd03cfe28855f555559390c931b](https://arbiscan.io/token/0x24404dc041d74cd03cfe28855f555559390c931b)

Right now there are Moons on Arbitrum One, however the entire history of the Moon contract on One currently comes down to two transactions.

#Update:

To determine the winning number, we will take the last 5 characters of the block hash of the first block mined on [Arbitrum one](https://arbiscan.io/) after the giveaway completes and convert it into [base-10.](https://www.thoughtco.com/definition-of-base-10-2312365) This creates a numerical range of 0-1048575, so in the case that the resulting number is over 1,000,000 we will use the subsequent blocks blockhash.

For example, the last 5 characters of [this block’s](https://arbiscan.io/block/191827019) blockhash are 6f298, which converted into base-10 gives a resulting value of 455,320.",CryptoCurrency,https://reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1bhiey0/giveaway_150_lucky_winners_will_be_part_of_cc/,2024-03-18 00:36:35,0.12643180574215057,0.4571702244116037,0.024,0.096,0.9811

As far back as I can remember. Several years I've always explained how this piece of shit alt will slowly fade. The warnings were there, hidden amidst the relentless shilling akin to late-night infomercials. As time unfolded, the cracks in its facade became apparent. 

Its fate, once seemingly destined for greatness, now hangs in the balance, a testament to the unpredictable nature of the crypto landscape.

Serious HODL question,"Serious question about HODLing Bitcoin. 

Our (spouse+me) current mortgage debt is $1.4M, at 2.6% interest rate - monthly mortgage payment is $6k. I expect to work for 10 more years, at the end of which the mortgage balance will be ~ $1M.

While we have retirement savings in 401k/IRA and in after-tax brokerage, I would prefer not using those funds for paying the mortgage.

Hence, I got into bitcoin. I have so far accumulated 2.65 bitcoins, which today is valued around $180k. If I HODL this stack for 10 more years, am I likely to have enough to pay my mortgage with it - I.e., about $1M.

I know that if I were to sell all my BTC at once, it will trigger a huge capital gains tax. Instead my plan would be HODL for 10 more years, and if the value of BTC reaches $1M or roughly the same as mortgage balance, then start DCA selling the BTC each month to pay the mortgage? Say, sell $9k per month of BTC, set aside enough to pay taxes, pay the remainder towards the mortgage for 15 more years.

Am I on the right track here? Or is BTC so volatile that a regular DCA selling strategy not likely to work out? In which case, should I just sell my BTC in a year or so and move the funds over to something less volatile like SPY?

BlackRock - The Next Move After the Bitcoin ETF,"As primarily a gold and commodities guy, I've been watching the crypto space for some time with some decent exposure to BTC, and recently have built a small alt coin and meme coin portfolio with the help of my nephew. With that said, when the BlackRock BTC ETF was approved, I was shocked because this is much bigger news than the crypto community here is taking for at face value. 

A long time ago I remember saying to my nephew who was involved in crypto ""it's an outright scam"". Over the years my opinion has shifted and with BlackRock arriving, I believe that things are going to become even more legitimate. BlackRock is not here to ""dabble"" in crypto or to stop at just an ETF. They are here to win and I can assure you this as the boomer in this group who has been observing with a BTC investment since 2017. 

This company is not going to stop at the ETF. Larry Fink clearly has greater plans and it is important to watch the moves BlackRock makes - Fink is explicit about pushing further into the world of tokenization ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTveRlW7QPo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTveRlW7QPo)).

I have no idea what their next steps are going to be, but I’m certain that there will be something. They have already teamed up with Coinbase as their ETF custodian and Coinbase has a real legal team, which makes them the most obvious continued crypto partner for anything and everything Blackrock will want to do. BlackRock is very smart in this sense because crypto is seen as a risk, as a scam. BlackRock knows this and will use Coinbase as an ally to continue its crypto mission for this very reason.

Now here is where things get interesting. My nephew has been explaining to me how the memecoin market works. Keep in mind he trades them in and out, but I’m more interested in holding the right coins for the rest of the year. Like gold and BTC, something I could hold and not look at for some time. When I first looked at these Memecoins charts I was suspicious, but the great George Soros has taught me that it’s much smarter to be early to a bubble then to avoid it altogether, so I have kept as open of a mind as possible. He also says to rush to join the bubble, and so I think everyone is now doing just that.

This is going somewhere I promise…my nephew was over for a family BBQ today and told me he bought a coin called ""Black Rock"" on Coinbase’s Base chain, but that it’s funny to him because it’s just a Black Rock. He showed me the website and it is just a picture of a rock. But then the lightbulb in my head went off. **If we pay close attention to Blackrock’s plans, and Larry Fink’s interview, then it’s only a matter of time before a headline hits talking about how BlackRock and Coinbase are working on their next great venture together**. When that happens I think the ROCK token that my nephew shared with me has the chance to be ""the big one"" for Base chain.

When I mention that BlackRock is not here to ""dabble"" they are here to win, I mean there strategy is not starting and stopping with an ETF. **The evidence is clear that Coinbase is the best possible partner for BlackRock. The odds that a headline creates immense FOMO in a Black Rock token on Base chain seems very high to me, and in my opinion is an amazing risk/reward that has resulted in me crafting this analysis to share with all of you.** You won’t see me on here much, but hopefully this post ages very well.

Crypto hasn't even begun to melt faces - A Market Risk Analysis - Part 2,"FOMO and Greed is slowly creeping up again. At the same time, this recent 12% pullback is casting some doubts. In general, it seems like people can't put a finger on where we seem to be in this cycle. 

Some Data I've been looking at suggests this is just the beginning. Let's put this sentiment into context by looking at different Market Risk Indicators.

**TL;DR**, we've got ways to go before we reach market risk similar to the last ATH - Part 2

The last time I posted this, people cricitized the rainbow chart (rightly so), so let's not use that one again.

**Weekly RSI (**[link](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BITSTAMP%3ABTCUSD)**)**

https://preview.redd.it/xt85kme4bxoc1.png?width=2069&format=png&auto=webp&s=1426b8b9092546a47287c18f746528d9a4910894

Historically, whenever we reached the previous ATH, the RSI went on to have a one-year long period of overvaluation until setting the next ATH. We've just now broken our ATH from 2021 and the RSI is just entering overvaluation. Judging from previous cycles, this run-up looks very similar to what we saw in 2017. We've barely experienced a true bullmarket so far. This might be the beginning of one.

**Alphasquared (**[link](https://alphasquared.io/)**)**

https://preview.redd.it/5xp4ferubxoc1.png?width=1834&format=png&auto=webp&s=da6b67f33a2c41eb99728adc726878125fba6998

Now this one is a tool I use specifically for evaluating market risk. Used it for the past year to stack bottom-level BTC and it's been unbelievably accurate. I'll start DCAing out at 80 risk and above.

The last time we broke through our previous 20k ATH in 2020, this indicator showed about 60 risk, which is where we are now. That's when the bull back then really started and sentiment on r/CryptoCurrency was similar to now. It feels eerily similar.

**Fear and Greed Index (**[link](https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/)**)**

https://preview.redd.it/pnt0wqc7cxoc1.png?width=1130&format=png&auto=webp&s=ecff9facadcc4796585f8ce9662206383190910c

We all know the Fear and Greed index, so no need to explain what it is. For this one, we shouldn't evaluate the Index value itself, but rather how long it stays there. Similar to the RSI.

In November of 2020 we were close to touching the old 20k ATH, the Fear and Greed Index indicated a market risk of 88 and it hadn't been there for long. Back then Bitcoin more than tripled in value and the F&G Index stayed in extreme greed territory for almost a whole year. How long have we been in extreme greed this cycle? About a month. History shows, we can keep pumping for so much longer.

**Verdict**

All of these indicators plot a clear picture of early bullrun days and we're nowhere near extreme risk valuations. So when asking yourself if you should take profits, continue to DCA or similar, keep this in mind. Historically speaking, we still have ways to go.",CryptoCurrency,https://reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1bh2saw/crypto_hasnt_even_begun_to_melt_faces_a_market/,2024-03-17 13:11:38,0.05532069970845483,0.4132118561710397,0.099,0.039,0.0
I read about the difference between hashgraph and blockchain. Which one is the future in the Crypto industry.,I just read an intresting article about how Hashgraph is the future technology in the crypto space. Blockchain is excellent but it has its limitations when it comes to scaling and other features. I dont want to say its older tech but it has been around for awhile now. Hashgragh does not have a scaling issue and solves alot of scaling and other problems in the crypto space.  the Hashgraph blocks can go sideways. Unlike blockchain. The article also stated that Hashgraph crypto projects can have a huge pump during the bull market. I'm not sure how many cryptos use Hashgraph but it might be worth researching. Can anyone give some more information about hashgraph crypto projects. What is  the differences between the two. will hashgragh be the future of ctypto or will blockchain be the future.,CryptoCurrency,https://reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1bh2fxb/i_read_about_the_difference_between_hashgraph_and/,2024-03-17 12:57:45,0.19722222222222227,0.4456018518518518,0.06,0.064,0.1591
Crypto vs Tech Stocks: Is crypto really as risky as the SEC says it is?,"On the 10th January 2024, history was made when the SEC granted the first spot Bitcoin ETF in the USA. The SEC was reluctant to approve the ETFs because, if you take them for their word, they wish to protect investors from speculative assets and losing money. So their statement of approval contained words of caution: “bitcoin is primarily a speculative, volatile asset.” and “Investors should remain cautious about the myriad risks associated with bitcoin and products whose value is tied to crypto”.

In this post I want to focus on the SEC’s warning that Bitcoin, and crypto in general, is a high risk investment. In isolation, that statement may be true. But plenty of tradable assets, approved by the SEC, are also considered ‘risky’. I couldn’t find SEC statements warning against investing in specific assets besides Bitcoin. So the implication here is that Bitcoin is especially risky, to the extent that investors should be warned against it so they do not lose money.

As a fun and informative exercise, I made four comparisons to highlight the relative risk of crypto vs tech stocks:

1. The worst investments anyone could have made ever

1. The worst investments from the most recent market crash

1. The largest market cap loss

1. ROI loss per day, historically and recently

This is a long post and I want to point out that if you appreciate clear data and objective analysis you might want to check out [DefiDive.com](https://defidive.com). This is a crypto price, news and asset management terminal that I have built. For now, think of it like Coinmarketcap with less clutter and distractions.

| Ethereum | Jan-2018 | Dec-2018 | $1,292.63 | $84.47 | $7 | -93% |
| Amazon | Apr-1999 | Sep-2001 | $5.53 | $0.28 | $5 | -95% |
| AMD | Jan-2006 | Sep-2015 | $42.01 | $1.65 | $4 | -96% |
| Peloton | Dec-2020 | Feb-2024 | $167.37 | $3.96 | $2 | -98% |

The worst investment possible in Bitcoin returned a -91% ROI and in Ethereum -93% ROI. In contrast, the ‘least worst’ investment is Alphabet with -65% ROI, the median investment is  Nvidia with -87% ROI, and the worst investment possible is Peoloton with -98% ROI. Bitcoin and Ethereum have produced bad losses for anyone buying the top and selling the bottom, but other tech stocks (Amazon, AMD, Peloton) have delivered worse ROI for unlucky investors.

It is worth noting that the market cap of Bitcoin in 2011 was $173MM vs Google in 2007 was $231B. In other words, Bitcoin was worth 0.07% of Google. Comparing Bitcoin’s market crash vs publicly traded tech stocks puts Bitcoin at a disadvantage because these tech stocks only have tradable shares once the company has grown to be large enough to list on a stock market. For example, Google was founded six years before becoming a publicly traded stock in 2004. Bitcoin became publicly tradable within a year of creation and Ethereum was publicly tradable from the moment it was launched. Ultimately we are comparing Bitcoin at age two years old, Ethereum three years old, and Google nine years old. It is reasonable to expect higher volatility from newer and smaller assets.

| Peloton | Dec-2020 | Feb-2024 | $167.37 | $3.96 | $2 | -98% |

Instead of using data from an asset’s entire history, this table compares the worst investments possible during the most recent market crash. All of the assets reached their respective bubble tops and market crashes at slightly different times, and Peloton might not have bottomed out yet. Bitcoin was the sixth worst asset and Ethereum was the third. This tells the same narrative that crypto investments can produce bad returns, but not necessarily much different from tech stocks.

To avoid penalising assets just for being small, comparing the maximum market cap lost is another useful perspective. Amazon is the only asset to lose over $1 Trillion in value. Ethereum performs better than an average for the first time in this analysis. The ranking of this table suggests Bitcoin is comparable to Big Tech, while Ethereum is comparable to the large cap tech.

By none of the measures studied so far has Bitcoin or Ethereum performed the worst. Some might argue that perhaps the risk in crypto comes from the speed at which an investor might lose money. So the following analysis looks at ROI % loss per day during market crashes.

**4. ROI Loss per Day: Crypto vs Tech Stocks** 

All-time worst market crash comparison:

Asset | Start Date | Crash Length (Days) | Average % change per Day 
---|---|----|----|----|----|----
| Microsoft | Dec-1999 | 3350 | -0.02% |
| AMD | Jan-2006 | 3530 | -0.03% |
| Apple | Mar-2000 | 1126 | -0.07% |
| Zoom | Nov-2020 | 1064 | -0.08% |
| Peloton | Dec-2020 | 1157 | -0.08% |
| Amazon | Apr-1999 | 884 | -0.11% |
| Alphabet (GOOGL) | Oct-2007 | 397 | -0.16% |
| Netflix | May-2011 | 458 | -0.17% |
| Meta | Aug-2021 | 426 | -0.18% |
| Tesla | Nov-2021 | 395 | -0.19% |
| Ethereum | Jan-2018 | 334 | -0.28% |
| Nvidia | Dec-2001 | 274 | -0.32% |
| Bitcoin | Jun-2011 | 153 | -0.60% |

Bitcoin lost -0.60% per day (average, non-compounding) during the 2011 crash. Which is almost twice as the next worst asset, Nvidia. However, we already established that Bitcoin was so small in 2011 that we aren’t making a fair comparison here. In the most recent market crash, Bitcoin’s ROI loss per day was -0.21%, which is similar to other tech stocks (see next table below)

Most recent market crash comparison:

Asset | Start Date | Crash Length (Days) | Average % change per Day 
---|---|----|----|----|----|----
| Zoom | Nov-2020 | 1064 | -0.08% |
| Peloton | Dec-2020 | 1157 | -0.08% |
| Apple | Dec-2021 | 365 | -0.08% |
| Alphabet (GOOG) | Oct-2021 | 426 | -0.10% |
| Microsoft | Dec-2021 | 304 | -0.12% |
| Amazon | Nov-2021 | 395 | -0.14% |
| Meta | Aug-2021 | 426 | -0.18% |
| Tesla | Nov-2021 | 395 | -0.19% |
| AMD | Nov-2021 | 334 | -0.20% |
| Bitcoin | Nov-2021 | 365 | -0.21% |
| Nvidia | Nov-2021 | 304 | -0.22% |
| Netflix | Oct-2021 | 243 | -0.31% |
| Ethereum | Nov-2021 | 242 | -0.32% |

In the most recent crash Ethereum lost -0.32% per day (average non-compounding). That is clearly the worst result here, but only one percentage point worse than Netflix. It is somewhat impressive that Zoom and Peloton have the lowest average ROI loss per day, but that is limited comfort to investors if the stock price never recovers. Objectively, with Ethereum already rebounding from $1.1K in Dec-22 to $3.9K in Mar-24, Ethereum has been a better investment than Peloton even if you did get rekt along the way.

**Conclusion**

Out of everything I have studied (not all of which made it into the final cut of this blog post), I find this graph the most useful for summarising potential losses when investing in crypto and tech stocks:

https://i.imgur.com/akl87Jk.png

Looking back at the SEC’s statement, it does seem unfair to single Bitcoin out as a volatile asset when Bitcoin performed similarly to commonly traded tech stocks during the most recent market crash. It feels like the SEC statement is talking about Bitcoin’s volatility as if it is 2011. If we were to take the SEC’s statement as gospel, we would expect this analysis to show Bitcoin and Ethereum are significantly more risky than tech stocks. Instead Bitcoin performed similarly to other tech stocks during the recent market crash and Ethereum performed not much worse. 

**A Sidenote on Beta**

Beta is a measure of an asset's correlation to the broader market. This can be used as a proxy for measuring risk. Tech stocks have become so large that they effectively become ‘the broader market’. You can see below they all have betas close to one. In other words, if big tech share prices go up (or down), so does the S&P 500. Crypto has little correlation to the S&P 500, partly because it has outperformed it over the past 14 years. This gives crypto a beta close to 0, which effectively means anything or nothing could happen when the S&P 500 rises or falls. The beta for crypto has increased since 2020 but it is still far away from other tech stocks. In practice, this means that crypto could be considered as a method to diversify away from tech stocks / S&P 500. Ironically, you could make the argument that this helps lower the overall risk of a portfolio if someone invests sensibly into crypto to achieve more diversification.

Consolidating and looking for opinions…,"Bought in to various coins several years ago and forgot about them. I have some modest gains, nothing crazy.

After receiving alerts and headlines from this latest bull run that has seemingly plateaued, I thought it might be a good idea to consolidate some of my smaller bags into ADA and/or ALGO. I currently have 7 different coins and want to limit it to 4.

Without crypto friends to lean on, Im curious what the community preferences are. This is not a big play or anything, just cleaning up my accounts so I can forget about them again without being too spread out. 

Of these two options, ada/algo only, which would you add to? Thx for any insight.

The memecoin portfolio experiment. 2nd week,"[First week](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1bbl65q/the_memecoin_portfolio_experiment_first_week/)

This second week has been quite bloody for the Memecoin portfolio. Except two of these coins (PIP and POPCAT), the rest went down quite a bit ""Growth WoW""  (week-over-week). 

I decided to add a new column of information (WoW) and also the growth of BTC and my ""normal"" portfolio to compare with.

SOLAMA is holding better than I expected and POPCAT, on the contrary that I was expecting, didn't implode yet, and it even increased on value.

Two of them lost more than 50% of their value WoW, but so far the portfolio is still in green compared to the initial investment (167% up). 

This week, my portfolio behaved better than  BTC and the Memecoin Portfolio.

Which coin do you think it's goin to be the one in losing more than 90% of the initial investment amount?

See you next week!

Problem bridging eth from mainnet to nova,"EDIT: Just an update to say what a palava that was. Had to get some donated eth in the end. My bank won't allow card crypto purchases anymore. Anyway, despite the horrible horribleness of eth, using the arbitrum bridge was not fun. For some reason it used $¹1 of gas, gave me $32 on Nova, and left $4 stranded on mainnet, but I can get that back in my other wallet. 

Swapping on arbitrum was super easy, very quick. Anyway, so long Moons and thanks for the cash! Hope everyone staying in gets to the actual moon. 

Good luck folks.

Hi, as the title says, I'm having trouble bridging my ethereum from the mainnet to arbitrum nova in metamask. I have eth on mainnet and my moons on nova. When I go to the bridge in app, I can select ethereum as the start network, and the amount. However, arbitrum nova doesn't appear in the destination dropdown box, only arbitrum itself. 

If this doesn't work, I'll wait until the Camelot partnership comes up in a couple of days, but I'm keen to swap my moons, and am just stuck at this step.

"Exchange tokens reach their alt again, despite being ""alt coins"".","Edit, I meant to write ""reach their ATH again"" on the title.



I think this defeats the narrative that most alt coins don't reach ever ATH again. For sure, some exchange tokens might disappear almost entirely if the exchange adoption is negligible and/or there is no utility, but in any other case, they are a safe investment if someone wants an alt with guaranteed gains.

This doesn't mean that diversification and risk management should not remain essential principles for building a resilient cryptocurrency portfolio.

Cashing out shitcoins from metamask w/o eth in the U.S.?,"If I have some cutecat coin on metamask on the bsc network (or polygon - it doesn't matter), and I'm ready to turn it back in to dollars, is there any way to do this without going through the Ethereum mainnet? 

I imagine the first step is swapping the cutecat coin into something more liquid like USDT or TRX or MATIC or MANA or whatever, before sending the USDT to the exchange to sell. But the exchanges I'm familiar with will only let me select the network when sending out from the exchange - but NOT when receiving back into the exchange. And the default networks on the exchanges are Ethereum.

I can avoid high fees when sending to metamask by selecting Arbitrum One or Polygon etc. as the network. But if I send USDT to the exchange on the polygon network or any other network other than Ethereum mainnet, it gets lost.

"Sky is falling, Bitcoin will never recover","Kidding. KIDDING!! **KIDDING!!!!**

But seriously, expect we'll recede a bit more. Then probably re-boom as spring sets in.

The Stock market has been extremely bullish. Based upon historical, this trend has a high probability of continuing all year. Which means Bitcoin will follow and boom too.

NASDAQ futures are up a crushing 70% since the trend change in October. A staggering rip. This current week we're finishing in an area where the stock markets shifts notably to a weaker structure due to massive amounts of expirations of option positions. Next two weeks it would not be surprising to see more red. 20%? No. 3 to 7%? Wouldn't be surprising. This'll pull crypto down some as well. 

But after, as I said based upon historical, this trend has a high probability of continuing all up year. Least for 2024. 

Side note, sadly, it'll mean inflation is here to stay. Which is good for Bitcoin. But, bad for society and the future.

Got scammed 11g,"Hello,

I was using coinbase and solflare wallet.

I was having issues with coin base and called what I thought was there customer support for help. It was not their customer support and was a scam. 

They ended up being able to access my solflare wallet and emptied it within seconds. 11g gone. 

I called coinbase they are not helpful. 

I was directed to go to police and I will. 

What if anything can I do????? Fuck gang. So fucking heartbroken and devastated right now

"Solana is currently congested with an Average Ping Time of 20-40s, 30-50% Ping loss, up to 50-80% failed transactions. Still unable to exceed 1200 True TPS.","[https://solscan.io/](https://solscan.io/) shows the Average Ping Time and drops at the bottom of their main page. There is currently about 30-50% loss and an average ping time of 20-40s. This means if you submit a transaction, it'll take that long before it gets included, and it has a high chance of not being included.

The whole network has been congested for days, and a lot of people are complaining about this in the Solana community.

[High average ping time and loss](https://preview.redd.it/y31j59t27soc1.png?width=892&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c1ead6919ba0df91eaf8a4f1730b7a58972150e)

In addition, there are tons of failed non-vote transactions. I'm estimating around 50-80% of Tx are failing. This is due to all the spam and MEV that's been going on due to excessive meme coin activity on Solana. (If you don't believe me, just pick a random block on [https://solscan.io/blocks](https://solscan.io/blocks) and scroll down past the vote transactions.)

[Failed transactions in a block](https://preview.redd.it/8f2gh88j7soc1.png?width=1702&format=png&auto=webp&s=84c9c2328b6c2f6f176e26898d684c7a158c9e46)

Most of you probably already know that Solana is not a 50k TPS network due to vote transactions. It's just marketing BS and misreporting.

For the longest time, I've suspected that Solana maxes out at 1100-1200 TPS in real life conditions. This is proof that even when the network is full with 30-50s wait times, it does not exceed 1200 True TPS. I've checked this chart dozens of times in the past 2 years during Solana congestion, and highest I've ever seen was 1200 True TPS.

[Today's True TPS is about 900-1100 TPS](https://preview.redd.it/61n4zzaf8soc1.png?width=882&format=png&auto=webp&s=a58878c55176e7229e436c8f847312f0e4af355a)

On average, non-vote transactions account for 10-20% of the total transactions. And the daily average of True TPS is about 300-400 TPS. Even during the spike in Dec 2023, it did not exceed 800 TPS.

[Daily TPS](https://preview.redd.it/hpboii4g8soc1.png?width=703&format=png&auto=webp&s=94f057de59494cb3fe73f6a9937051a41035078a)

**12.** Moons have **intangible value!**

Back in 17th century Europeans traded with New England Natives, the natives didn't use silver or gold, they used durable skeleton parts of animals they hunted down. It was mostly sea-shell money - wampum. Wampump then spread far away from clam's habitat into other tribes. They also made artful blades and necklessess. Blades that weren't made for cutting but for sheer enjoyment. Collecting and decorating things originates all back to Africa. People like doing things for fun, it's irrational and not practical but we do it. We trade with it or pass it to our children. Like some animals, humans learned that non-kin altruism grew community stronger. 

We put our feelings, thoughts and knowledge into our contributions and grow, protect and guide our community. As we did **after sunset**. We as a community create then capture that value!

Earning Moons is proof of our contributions to the community and reputation that can be carried across the web once other apps start displaying social tokens!

**13.** There are plans of **expanding Moons to other platforms in the next 12 months**!

**14.** Moons have **small mcap** and small circulating supply in comparison to many other tokens!

* If **Moons** had  **Bonk**'s market cap of **$1.6B**, 1 MOON would be worth **$20.51**, an upside of **58x**  
* If  **Moons** had **dogwifhat**'s market cap of **$2.2B**, 1 MOON would be worth **$26.78**, an upside of **76x**
* If **Moons** had  **Shiba Inu**'s market cap of **$14.5B**, 1 MOON would be worth **$180.61**, an upside of **518x**
* If  **Moons** had  **Dogecoin**'s market cap of **$20.3B**, 1 MOON would be worth **$252.39**, an upside of **725x** 
* If  **Moons** had  **Dogecoin**'s ATH market cap of **$88B**, 1 MOON would be worth **$1060**

**15.** Moons have **yet to be listed** on several big exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, KuCoin

Best way to self custody different coins?,"Hi all, this is my first crypto cycle and as a newbie I would appreciate an advice on storing my crypto keys. 

I bought into a few mid-cap projects and at this point I want to move my assets from the exchange into (ideally) a cold wallet. 

I had Trezor or Ledger in mind, but quickly realised none of the cold wallets support all of the assets I have. I had a look into hot wallets and equally couldn't find any that would support all my assets. Is that normal? Would I simply need to have 3 different wallets to store all my crypto or am I missing something? 

If this is indeed the case it seems quite annoying, having to flipflop between the wallets, instead of having everything in one place. 

Also probably worth mentioning I don't intend to stake, trade or do anything with my crypto, just hold it in a wallet.

"Questions about storage, updatability, and privacy on using NFTs for legal deed and will writing","How does the process unfold when one embarks on creating an NFT tailored for will and legal deed services? Are there specific steps and considerations involved in ensuring the efficacy of such NFTs in managing legal documents and services?

I have a couple more questions in the following areas.

Storage

1. In terms of storage, is the preferred method for NFTs in this domain off-chain storage, utilizing platforms such as IPFS, or is on-chain storage within the blockchain more advisable? What are the factors influencing this decision, and how do they impact accessibility, security, and scalability?

Updatability

2. Considering the dynamic nature of legal documents like wills and deeds, how does one address the need for updatability within the context of NFTs? Is storing these documents directly on the blockchain a viable option, or is off-chain storage a more practical solution to facilitate seamless updates while preserving data integrity?

Privacy

3. Privacy is paramount when dealing with sensitive legal documents. How can NFTs for will and legal deed services be effectively secured and hidden from the public, ensuring that only authorized individuals have access to them?

On The Availability Of Businesses Accepting Crypto Transactions,"Earlier this week I had a question posed to me where the answer may not be as easy as I thought. Specifically, what's the availability of businesses accepting cryptocurrency transactions across the lower 48 states?

I found the answer to be quite elusive in the sense that it appears some major companies will accept crypto as a form of direct payment, but most small/mid-sized businesses will not. I'm also seeing a trend where the use of crypto as a form of payment is fairly limited based on the size of the city a person is trying to make the payment in.

The woman asking me the question is looking to possibly retire in Buena Vista, Colorado - home to about 4000 people. I did some research and didn't find a definitive source containing a list of businesses that accept crypto as direct payment in that town - although there may be one out there somewhere. I found a few old posts saying direct payment is not common in this town, with vendors citing volatility and transaction fees as the reasons why (All parties were trying to use BitCoin).

Has anyone else ran into this issue? Is it safe to assume that the use of crypto as a currency still has a ways to go in terms of overall acceptance in the US? Or do I just need a better source?

Any help/insights are greatly appreciated.

Moons are about to get a whole bunch of Farming Rewards on Arbitrum One.,"As you've probably seen in the recent [announcements](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1be3o67/announcing_partnerships_with_celer_and_camelot_to/) Moons are going to be available on One and are going to be partnering with both Celer and Camelot.

* Celer will work with pooled Moons on One/Nova for a near instantaneous bridge + Rewards for Bridge liquidity providers
   * **285,000 Celer tokens will be distributed over the first 60 days the bridge is live.**
* Camelot is the #1 Dex on Arbitrum and they will be providing DEX rewards - however the exact amount hasn't been announced.

Importantly these open up new farming opportunities for Moon holders something that we haven't had since Sushi rewards were put on hold when distributions ended.

\---------------------------

**Celer in particular offers a unique way to earn rewards with 0 impermanent loss** for Moon Holders, how it works is you provide bridge liquidity and since you aren't trading Moons for another asset you don't have imperm loss - you just farm fees from people bridging their Moons between Nova/One + the additional Celer rewards.

Alternatively users can provide DEX liquidity on Camelot to earn rewards but again the exact value hasn't been announced. This farming option is subject to impermanent loss as you're putting your assets to trade on a DEX.

\---------------------------

It's important to note that neither option is 100% ""risk free"" - whenever Moons leave your wallet whether that's; moving Moons to an exchange like Kraken, providing bridge liquidity, or providing Dex liquidity - there is a 3rd party risk when a 3rd party holds your Moons.

Regardless new utility for Moons on One could definitely make things interesting.

QR coin update since Vitalik Unveiled a Potential Emergency Plan against Quantum Hacking Threats,"
After Vitalik put out an approach Ethereum could take to fight off an attack from Quantum Computing, QR coins have been trending.

QR- Quantum Resistant.

QANX- steady climb ahead of mainnet push. Recent news of an EU country utilizing the QR tech stack seems to be driving the recent surge. ETH like design, PoS, with multi-language smart contracts and dev royalties.

CELL- had 6-8x gain since Jan. A bit of a pullback recently. Appears to be more of a DOT type design. Had a Coin Bureau club review video which didn't do much, but some buzz around Kelvpn seems to be helping.

QRL- Built for QR years ago, and was quiet until recently. May have been because it was hard to buy, but Mexc was added, and they are working to add in evm and smart contracts.

Algo- Most are familiar, it appears to have added Falcon as quantum resistance for consensus purposes, but I haven't seen if they have a solution defined for Digital Signature- which is the primary issue Vitalik was prepared for.

XX, AME and a few others I know less about, but worth a look.

These coins have the QR label- but none are simply trying to be quantum resistant.

They realized being prepared for quantum computing will be a requirement of ALL systems and all chains. It's not a debate- it will be needed, and the only discussion is how long do you want to risk being exposed.

On top of having the foresight to implement this, they have their vision for how to take crypto to the next level.   Definitely worth a look- intriguing projects on their own merit, prepared for the inevitable quantum narrative.

Why does gold have intrinsic value but Bitcoin doesn’t?,"I saw some folks here on Reddit arguing that Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme. It encouraged me to start a discussion on why this is not the case. When I buy a piece of Bitcoin, I’m buying because I expect the price to go up similar to when I buy real estate, stocks, or any other type of asset. Sure, you could argue that sometimes you get a dividend when you buy a stock because you are investing in a real business that generates a profit. But Bitcoin is different. Bitcoin is the new gold. Even infamous gold bugs like Larry Lepard are finally coming to this realization. Gold does not generate any dividends. It's a commodity. Bitcoin is digital gold. Per the World Gold Council, approximately half of gold’s supply is either used for jewelry or as a store of value, meaning most of the supply has no industrial purpose. Only 8% of its supply is used for medical, dentistry, or technology use. You can also make artificial gold although it’s expensive to do so. As the great Michael Saylor once famously said, Bitcoin has all the great attributes and none of the defects as gold. So why does gold have intrinsic value but Bitcoin does not?



# Why Bitcoin is superior to gold 



##### *Infinitely divisible*

You need a certain amount of gold to actually use it for the few use cases it possesses. A Bitcoin can be divided infinitely. Anyone can store a fraction of a Bitcoin. 

##### *Instantaneous, seamless transactions* 

A person or entity once sent 2 billion dollars overseas in a matter of minutes for the cost of a couple pennies. Per CoinTelegraph “A notable Bitcoin transaction occurred where $2 billion was moved with only a $0.78 fee. This transaction showcases the efficiency of cryptocurrency for transferring large sums at minimal costs, contrasting sharply with traditional banking fees that could range between $20 million to $60 million for a similar amount.” This wipes gold out of the water. To transfer a similar amount of gold, you would need to be coordinating with a logistics company that charges a fortune, requires the purchase of insurance to prevent theft, and will take weeks if not months to reach its final destination. 

##### *Bitcoin is the only asset that stays with you after death* 

If you shoot me, you can break in and live in my house. The government can seize your gold, stocks, and entire bank account. They can't touch your Bitcoin.  

##### *Digital ledger technology* 

Every transaction is on the blockchain. In one particular interesting case, this creates transparency among a country and its citizens. El Salvador just recently posted their address as they informed the public they transferred their holdings to cold storage. You can track every transaction the address has ever had. Anybody can perform an audit whenever they want. 

##### *You can’t counterfeit bitcoin* 

You can't counterfeit Bitcoin because it operates on a blockchain that records all transactions across a network of computers. Each Bitcoin transaction is verified by multiple participants in the network, and once a transaction is recorded on the blockchain, it cannot be altered. This system ensures the authenticity of each Bitcoin and prevents duplication or creation of fake Bitcoins.

##### *The supply is fixed at 21 million coins*
Recently on a livestream Benjamin Cowen noted Neil deGrasse Tyson saying that if we find some galaxy or planet that holds a surplus of gold it would instantly become worthless. This possibility cannot happen with Bitcoin for obvious reasons. 

##### *Bitcoin is practical* 
You can’t pay for your groceries in gold bars. With Bitcoin, although it’s not popularized yet, there are many markets that accept Bitcoin payments and many applications that allow you to purchase goods and services with Bitcoin. 

##### *Bitcoin is digital property*

Is DCAing into alts weekly in 2024 and holding till 2025 a silly strategy?,"I’ve been DCAing into crypto since mid 2023 and throughout 2024 and plan to continue this approach through to end of 2024. What is everyone’s opinion, is DCAing into alts at this point in time a silly strategy and do you reckon it would be smarter to instead lump sum and take short term positions (I.e weekly/monthly positions). I understand it depends on my personal situation etc, and no one really knows what will happen but how does everyone see these cycles playing out.  

I’m planning to hold and sell everything till end of 2025 when I’m assuming the market will top. I understand I miss out on gains by DCAing but what’s everyone’s take, would now be an ideal time to continue/begin DCAing and build positions as we haven’t hit alt season yet or do you see a major correction occurring end of 2024 after the BTC halving (which would mean it might be smarter to short term trade and get back in the pull back)

I consider myself more of a passive investor so to me DCAing takes the stress/time out of being so involved in the markets. With rate cuts most likely occurring end of 2024 I don’t see this momentum stopping either. I’m up on my positions but they aren’t the biggest either, so I’m conflicted on weather I’ve chosen the smartest approach…

Good strategy?,"Hi.
So I bought some solana a few months ago and am currently about 350% up on it. I am thinking of selling a third to cover my costs. The rest I would leave to go higher and then take profits.

My thinking is that if I cover my costs and the rest crashes, I am on net 0 and not in a loss. And in case it goes even higher, I still have profits (even though they would be a third smaller - I am OK with that though.)

Is this a good strategy? Am I being too careful, or am i thinking correctly?

What's up with Solana meme coins? ,"It seems like completely random meme coins on Solana have been popping up out of nowhere and going 10-1000x in a really short period of time.

I did a bit of digging and found out on Dexscreener that there are quite a lot of really small coins on Solana and they are created every day. Most of them obviously have no real value and they look like pump and dump schemes. It's really the closest thing to a casino I've seen in the cryptocurrency space. 

It's understandable that most of these coins end up nowhere, but how do some of them explode to such a high degree? Like one of the largest coins Dogwifhat WIF which went from 0.0001 to 2.5 dollars. And Book of Meme (BOEM) is the latest trending one, it skyrocketed straight after its release. These coins have such random names, they don't even associate with anything trending (at least on a large scale) so it's hard to pinpoint what exactly is driving the price action for these coins. Could it be some kind of an inside job? Has anyone done a deeper research about this topic?

SoftJourn’s Ticketing Trends in 2024 - one is ‘open’ - what can blockchain do?,"Ticketing trends 2024(SoftJourn): Open - what can blockchain do?


In 2023 Softjourn wrote a great article about the event ticketing trends to keep an eye on in 2024. It comes down to:

- The Rise of Open Distribution
- Technology Advancements to Prevent Fraud
- Engaging Millenials With Advanced Technology
- Balancing High and Low-Demand Events: Dynamic Pricing and Timed-Entry
- Technologies to Connect In-Person & Virtual Events
- Improved Access Control to Improve Fan Experience
- Utilizing AI Tools and Real-Time Data
- Technology Upgrades for Compliance & Better User Experience
- A Greater Focus on Accessibility

During the last bull run we saw many projects using blockchain approaches to fill in these trends. After 3 years we’ve seen them coming and going. 

I still see lots of potential growing with projects that are still out there, and new ones too.

The first one: OPEN !! Is one that I like. So lets dive in there, why this is a good idea.

The author states: <quote> 

‘we are witnessing the ticketing industry shift towards more open distribution strategies. 

Traditional secondary markets are evolving, and ticket exchanges are no longer confined to being secondary. Open or multichannel distribution strategies have become beneficial for both buyers and sellers. 

These technologies create a trusted relationship across the entire ecosystem, broadening access to inventory where consumers shop. With more events appearing on multiple exchanges, the industry is adapting to a decentralized ticket-buying experience.’

They dive deeper into it by explaining the 5 advantages they see:

While open distribution can bring some challenges, ticketing platforms will also see these advantages, copied from the article:

Increased Inventory Turnover: 
With the ability to distribute tickets through various channels, ticketing companies can optimize the utilization of ticket inventory. This means tickets are sold more quickly, leading to improved inventory turnover and, in turn, increased revenue.

Data Monetization: 
Open distribution provides access to a wealth of data from various channels and platforms. Ticketing companies can leverage this data for analytics and insights. They can monetize this information by offering data-driven services and reports to event organizers and promoters.

Partnership Opportunities: 
Collaboration within the open distribution ecosystem can lead to partnerships with event organizers, venues, and other stakeholders. These partnerships can be lucrative and mutually beneficial, resulting in shared revenue streams and access to a broader customer base.

Flexibility in Pricing: 
Open distribution strategies enable ticketing companies to have more control over pricing. They can adjust prices dynamically based on market demand, competitor pricing, and other factors, allowing them to maximize their profit margins.

Reduced Fraud and Counterfeiting: 
By implementing secure ticketing technologies and blockchain-based systems, ticketing companies can reduce the risk of fraudulent ticket sales. This not only protects consumers but also helps ticketing companies maintain their reputation and credibility.

Bringing tickets on chain seems the way to go when you’re after 2024 trends in ticketing. We did not even discuss the others that were listed. The AI is interesting too.

I would like to hear if there are other projects out there with a similar approach to open.",CryptoCurrency,https://reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1bg2dfa/softjourns_ticketing_trends_in_2024_one_is_open/,2024-03-16 05:38:58,0.12838957759412306,0.5022750229568411,0.024,0.127,0.99

This has since normalized, and lines of credit slowly increasing at par with stables in the system.

For Comparison, interest charged on CEXes:

* Coinbase advertises [a 'low APR of 8.7%'](https://www.coinbase.com/en-gb/borrow)
* Binance flexible USDT can even reach an annualized rate of [around 29%](https://www.binance.com/en/loan)

The ecosystem is evolving. We don't know what the future will be. But the fact that there are actual products enabling real world usage of Bitcoin without giving up control of the keys (*or waiting some 30 years to 'sell some and live off the rest'*) is exciting!

As always, this is not financial advice. DYOR before using any of the products.

Does anyone know if an app that shows the log chart?,"As some of you know, the logarithmic chart can be very valuable when researching crypto due to its ""volatility"" and massive gains. I would like to find an app that makes it easily available, or just available

If you don't know what I'm talking about, let chatgpt fill in some blanks Logarithmic charts are valuable in crypto research for several reasons: 

Visualizing Growth: Cryptocurrency prices can experience exponential growth or decline. Logarithmic scales compress large price ranges, making it easier to visualize percentage changes over time. This is crucial for understanding long-term trends and identifying patterns that might be obscured on linear charts.

Comparing Assets: Logarithmic charts allow for more accurate comparisons between different cryptocurrencies, especially when their prices have vastly different magnitudes. It helps in comparing their growth rates relative to each other. 

Detecting Trends: Logarithmic charts can reveal trends, support, and resistance levels more clearly than linear charts. Trends that appear linear on a logarithmic scale can indicate sustainable growth or decline. 

Long-Term Analysis: For long-term investors or analysts, logarithmic charts provide a clearer perspective on the Overall trajectory ofa cryptocurrency. They help in assessing whether the asset has been growing steadily or experiencing extreme volatility. 

Overall, logarithmic charts are essential tools for investors and researchers in the crypto space, offering insights into the complex dynamics of price movements over time.",CryptoCurrency,https://reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1bfyt5e/does_anyone_know_if_an_app_that_shows_the_log/,2024-03-16 01:24:36,0.09591097308488614,0.4650103519668737,0.0,0.185,0.9913

I want to create a fun meme coin, similar to Dogecoin, that stands on its own like **Dogecoin**. I’m thinking of naming it **AMOGUS COIN**, inspired by the popular **Amogus** meme from the game **Among Us**. In the game, there are 15 players, and among them, 3 are impostors.

Here’s my concept: Each mined block will contain **20% impostor coins**. These impostor coins can suddenly disappear without a trace, just like impostors in the game. The tokens can be sent and received, but neither the sender nor the recipient will know which coins are impostors. The disappearance of impostor coins will be determined during mining and transaction confirmation.

The process of creating new coins will also include generating **20% impostor coins**, which will eventually be eliminated. For example, when we reach block 10 in the blockchain, we decide to eliminate impostors from block 6. The marked impostor coins will be removed, regardless of their wallet location. After this process, coins originating from the block where they were created will be considered safe and free from impostors.

During transactions, senders and recipients won’t know which coins are impostors and which are genuine.

My plan is for mining per block to last only **1 minute**. Each mining session will produce **1 million coins**, with **200,000 impostor coins**. There’s no limit to the total number of coins, similar to Dogecoin. The block reward will decrease by **20% every 100,000 blocks**, while the number of impostor coins created remains constant. For instance, if halving occurs at block 100,001, the total coins produced will be 800,000, with 160,000 impostor tokens per block.

What do you think? What can be improved, or any other idea before I started?

Vacation Travels with your Crypto Phone,"Phones/ Crypto/ Vacations/ Travel

I’m going on Vacation to Mexico soon, and was wondering if it’s secure to travel with my phone considering I have all my Hot Wallets and Exchange Apps on there?  

Has anybody been hacked or lost their phone while on vacation?  

Am I just being Paranoid? 

Should I use this opportunity to get another phone and retire my current phone to Crypto use only?

"Found wallet seed, but it is empty","Hi,

In 2022, a family member sadly passed away unexpectedly. We knew he was into Crypto and we actually found 2 wallet's seed. One was hidden behind a photo frame (inside the frame, so we had to remove the picture in order to find it). Another was in a black notebook in a random page.

I recovered the 2 wallets successfully but, I can't see anything on them. I assumming I need to be in the right network to be able to check? I checked for BTC, ETH, BSC, etc but nothing. No transactions either as I would appreciate if they were emptied but no, so no history which leads me to believe, I don't know what to look for...

Any advise?

UPDATE 2: I found an old email from 2018. He wanted to send 1 litecoin to a family member through me: 

""Just to note i have 20 different crypto currencies. 

Bitcoin, litecoin, monero, neo, maybe you want me to transfer it using one of these options?
Ofcourse it convienient if you have a card setup for quick widravals""

What should I be looking on the hard drives? Unfortunately the partner took his personal computer when he passed so no real access to that. I managed to recover access to 3 different email accounts but no luck with anything related to crypto. There is 1 other account that I will need to gain access to, hoping that will be the one.

How does a CEX determine the initial listing price of a new coin?,"For example, let's say that a CEX like Binance is about to list a brand new coin or ERC-20 token, doesn't really matter, called XYZ. 

Let's say that during the last round of the last token sale, XYZ went for $0.05 per XYZ. Let's also say that they sold 20% of all the total supply during those sales, and raised $10M. The token sale rounds started at $0.01, so we can assume most people bought at that lower price, while some bought closer to $0.05 per XYZ. Let's also assume that the 20% of XYZ sold during the token sales is the only supply that will be unlocked at TGE, the rest will be vested and have a 6-month cliff or something. 

Finally, let's assume that the first exchange that will list XYZ is Binance. I know that's unlikely that Binance would be the first, but humor me. Given what you know about the tokenomics, how would Binance determine the initial price of XYZ once it's listed on Binance? 

Would it also be $0.05 per XYZ by default? Or would it be higher? If so, why? And thanks in advance!",CryptoCurrency,https://reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1bfqw0g/how_does_a_cex_determine_the_initial_listing/,2024-03-15 18:48:58,0.07575757575757575,0.42030303030303023,0.013,0.055,0.8574

How do so many people still not see the grift?,"Transcript from the ""What Bitcoin did"" Podcast with Samson Mow

&nbsp; 

>Mow:  
Bitcoin um that's tricky and I think a lot of people didn't fully understand how things work even bitcoiners because they were dollar cost averageing and getting small 50k sat utxos which in High fee environments become unspendable even the pokker chip I just gave you it's you know it's 10K sets that will be unspendable at some point yeah and the whole concept of utxl management was really not considered and also I think for lightning not to FUD lightning I don't want to be seen as some guy that's like attacking lightning but we have to address the realities of it lightning was really designed to interact regularly with the main chain, Channel closes, Force Channel closes , opening it has to work with the main chain and the Assumption was that fees were low at least for most people for both utxo and lightning usage but that was never going to be the case because as more people use Bitcoin everything becomes more scarce and the costs go up especially in Fiat terms.

>McCormack:  
do you think lightning eventually Fades away or it just becomes uh something where you and I wouldn't really open channels we would just be using somebody else's it just becomes this kind of I don't know centralized uh Hub model where we can dip in and out 
>
>&nbsp; 
>
>Mow:
I think that's probably the outcome for lightning that it just is an interop layer between different other systems like liquid fedimint chaumian mints and other things we haven't yet thought of because it works really well as a you know a communication layer between those things but the problem is everything tends toward centralization for optimization right so most lightning hubs now are big players they're you're you're almost like using a custodial service because they're the backbone of the network at this point they're kind of like Banks kind of yeah and the reason is because it's more efficient to do it that way if you have to run your own lightning node yourself and do all that channel management it's a lot of work and you have to deal with all the routing so let's take Aqua for example we're working with bolts on the back end to do the swaps between liquid and lightning if there's a problem with say strike we have a a slack group with strike we can chat with them and and fix the issues there and solve it same with anybody else that's not something your average lightning node Runner will be able to do to optimize how they're routing routing their lightning transactions around the network so all of this stuff tends towards centralization and that be gets question is that okay and if you're okay with lightning with centralized hubs then you should be okay with Federation also or with a fedimint

Here is the man who was, with the company that employed him, fundamentally involved in limiting Bitcoins throughput. Telling you smugly that it ""just"" didn't work out as they thought. ""Oopsiii"" ""We're sorry"" and in the same sentence telling you that you should be ok and accept custodians again.

You can't tell me they didn't know.

And the icing on the cake:

Best crypto debit cards for use in the EU,"Hi everyone

I'm looking for a card to spend crypto with, mainly for daily activitities like buying groceries or buying gas. I'll only use this card in the EU, but I'm planning to travel around sometime soon so the card should be accepted in most countries within the EU.

I've used the CDC card in the past but ever since they rugpulled their card holders I've stopped using them. Coinbase and Binance are also not an option for me, since Coinbase doesn't operate in the EU (can anyone confirm?) and Binance has had too many regulatory issues in the past.

People have suggested Plutus and Nexo to me. Can anyone confirm that these cards are worthwile? Are there any other cards that I should be aware of?

I'm not looking for huge givebacks. A useful card to spend crypto in stores, with a low transaction cost, is perfect for me.

Exploring how LTO Network is reshaping the DeFi landscape with RWAs!," There are currently 1.3 billion USD of RWAs on-chain in crypto. This area grew to a total value of 1.05bn USD in 2023, 82% (855.7m USD) of which has come from treasuries, real estate, and private credit.
Major industry leaders from both the traditional financial and crypto worlds are calling RWAs the biggest growth area for crypto in the next cycle, and it is estimated that by 2030, there will be 16 trillion USD of RWAs on-chain.
It sounds like a great and growing ecosystem to be involved with, and the news and social media excitement surrounding this sector shows that the greater crypto community agrees. But for RWAs to reach their full potential, the current market needs more capable technologies to tokenize assets in a meaningful way. Even more so, it needs technology that allows this to occur in a decentralized manner.
The introduction of decentralized RWAs means that the greater crypto community and DeFi can start interacting with these RWAs in a much safer form. With centralized RWAs, an additional layer of trust is required between the Web3 community and the centralized parties performing the tokenization. If the centralized party disappears, the tokens representing the asset become useless. Therefore, these centralized RWAs are not a true and reliable store of value.
Tokenizing assets requires a strong legal framework as well as technology that can address the complex issues around ""identity"" and the demonstration of the legal ownership of the asset. Consequently, there is also the requirement to preserve the privacy of sensitive data that defines the legal status and ownership of the assets.
LTO Network has built a robust suite of technologies that work together and form our RWA ecosystem to address and solve the current issues surrounding RWAs.
Through the integration of our various DApps, we are able to provide the world's most robust and capable RWA platform to handle the entire lifecycle of assets, from on-chain tokenization to DeFi participation and back to off-chain interaction.",CryptoCurrency,https://reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1bflrqo/exploring_how_lto_network_is_reshaping_the_defi/,2024-03-15 15:08:29,0.16297619047619052,0.44214285714285706,0.025,0.225,0.9966

"GroveCoin and all Grove products are a ruthless facade - another scam token in the Safemoon scam ecosystem. Fake Royal Prince. Fake ""Coin"", fake volume..","#Strap your butts in.  

I've posted about Grove before, it didn't get a huge amount of traction because I assume everyone was busy laughing at how shit Safemoon is. Now that the horse is dead, thoroughly flogged and now rotting can I turn your attention to one of Safemoon's earliest and possibly scummiest partners Grove.  

##THIS WHOLE THING IS A FUCKING FUGAZI  

Honestly, every single part of it is just a complete smoke screen, where do I even begin?  

Probably with the funniest thing - [last week, they were reporting trading volume almost 2x higher than Binance](https://twitter.com/Bitc0inArmy/status/1762789850715979935).. Like.. $20 Billion dollars per day higher.  

[$48 Billion dollars of daily trading volume on GroveX, but only $2,000 of trading volume on Safemoon Swap.... riiiiiight.](https://x.com/SystemsTng/status/1763633229985190388?s=20)

And now a former team member has come out and said that not only did Grove team know about this erroneous reporting, [but they *intentionally* kept it that way because if it was accurate **it would show that barely anybody uses the exchange!**](https://twitter.com/TRUTH_1969/status/1768657082134204906)  

And as another side comment about their bullshit GroveX exchange, multiple people are having issues withdrawing funds with their USD withdrawals stuck processing for months at a time. [Weirdly enough, a savvy FUDDER managed to grab a team-members wallet \(Carlo\) and noticed Carlo is withdrawing an awful lot of USD from GroveX into another exchange... Coincidence?](https://twitter.com/NoValhalla4You/status/1767354023915778187)  

###The Fake Prince  

It all started when they claimed that Grove was endorsed by Dubai Royalty. The claim went that his Royal Highness Butti Bin Suhail Al-Maktoum is a private investor, with the official advisor **Bassam Al Falasi** and will bridge the link between Grove & officials in Dubai.  

As it turns out in a thrilling two-part article, not only is the connection to the Dubai Royal Family extremely tenuous, the dingleberry clinging on to the ass-hairs of the Dubai Royal family is also **pumping and dumping millions of dollars worth of tokens that the founders of Grove are giving him**  

[Falasi Uncovered: Part 1 — Faking Royalty](https://medium.com/@lynnscraggs/falasi-uncovered-part-1-faking-royalty-a2dc740bbec5)  

[Falasi Uncovered: Part 2 — Grifting the Grove Green Army](https://medium.com/@lynnscraggs/falasi-uncovered-part-2-grifting-the-grove-green-army-e9ab6b66fa55)  

###Can it get even stupider?

Yep! So officially, the token is called GroveC or GroveCoin. They made a big hullaballo about ""moving away from a Token and releasing their own Coin"" which in the Crypto world is the native asset on a blockchain. ADA is the coin of Cardano, ETH is the coin of Ethereum, BNB is the coin of BSC, etc.  

Well, as it turns out, they simply released another token on Binance Smart Chain, and changed the decimals so it was over a penny in value, rather than fractions of a penny.  

When called up on this, the immense fool Mendy (who claimed to invent Internet shopping) wrote this beautiful summary:  

>[To those that are having a time with their conversion, let me break it down really simple.  ](https://twitter.com/justbeingmendy/status/1609784036389421058)

> Token= fractions of pennies  
> Coin=whole pennies

Week 16 RCC Performance Tracker - Busy Week + Two New Tokens Added!,"Good Morning All! Happy Friday to all of you, if you're like me you got a bunch of notifications starting about 12 hours ago about the big dogs dropping. Thankfully I was asleep but was crazy to see the drop overnight and looks like things are starting to pick back up. 

There was a ton of news over the past week in the RCC space. I probably can't cover everything but I'll start off with the two new tokens that got added to the family: LIC (housed at Lama inu coin) and NNN (housed at nichs art nook).

LIC is a token you can earn through rewards and withdraw to your Polygon wallet. They have NFTs that you can stake for rewards as well. You'll also see down in my chart that I don't have LIC colorized yet, wasn't sure exactly which colors to go with so if I could get some feedback on that I would appreciate it! NNN is another token that is under the 3 month trial period, so just rewards you can earn. Shoutout to my guy [u/nichnotnick](https://www.reddit.com/user/nichnotnick)! One of the kindest dudes out there and if you like participating in giveaways then you need to check his sub out. The amount of giveaways they do over there is almost overwhelming!

Now to the tokens already around: GONE had a big week announcing their CEX listing with MEXC, which is huge news for them. I saw that it doubled their total volume in just over 24 hours from when they got listed. CONE had another huge announcement as well as they've been accepted into the affiliate program with Trezor and Ledger. There is a post pinned at the top of the sub with more info about that. The other one was just announced yesterday but you can now trade DONUT on Sushi.com which is huge news for them! I'll leave it for just those updates for now, other news about other tokens that I've not discussed please drop it in the comments so we can see what else may be going on.

Now for the data portion to see where everyone is at

Data from last week on 3.8.24:

https://preview.redd.it/eawebl9ymioc1.png?width=1370&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd6111775b35c6fb6389b87901687149b23852f6

And then info from this mornings pull:

https://preview.redd.it/w091xm1ymioc1.png?width=1426&format=png&auto=webp&s=c797fb7a9efbb1f9f765d511be7c5036b6f02055

1. The first thing that jumped off the page at me was holy DONUT! I knew they had a huge week, crossing the 5 cent mark and almost touched 6 cents earlier in the week. I had my screen grabber ready if it got close to 6.9 if I'm being honest. More than doubled it's market cap from last week, maybe they can catch Bricks if it continues. I think there will be more exciting things to come for the Donut crew down the road.
2. I think one thing that I was expecting to see when I pulled the data (after seeing the drops in the big boys earlier in the morning) was larger drops in the RCCs. There was a big pump over the course of the past week so any drop off might tempered by the prior pump. Some dropped yes but we'll see how if holds up for next week. One of the downsides of just tracking a moment in time on a Friday I guess.
3. Lots of milestones were accomplished was the next thing I picked up on. GONE smashed through the 23,000 holder mark, DONUT cracked the 6,000 holder mark, TACO & POOP are in a race to 1,000 sub members and both broke through 900.
4. I'm not sure what the deal is with the info on DexTools for MIKO. It's showing a drop in the price but picked up market cap? All the other numbers stayed the same so maybe there's a delay or something else happened? The other issue I ran into is the holder numbers for CMC on DOGE hasn't updated since March 3rd apparently.

That's all I've got for now. Hope you enjoyed reading and again if anyone has input for the colors for LIC feel free to hit me up.

Intersection of DePINs and AI,"DePINs and AI are increasingly intersecting, creating new opportunities and challenges. DePINs, which are decentralized networks of physical infrastructure managed through blockchain technology, are leveraging AI to enhance efficiency, automation, and decision-making. 

One key area of integration is in the management of resources. AI algorithms can analyze data from sensors in DePINs to optimize resource allocation, such as energy usage in smart grids or traffic flow in smart cities. This leads to improved efficiency and cost savings. 

Another application is in predictive maintenance. By using AI to analyze data from sensors, DePINs can predict when maintenance is needed, reducing downtime and improving the lifespan of infrastructure. 

Security is also a critical aspect. AI-powered systems can detect anomalies in data patterns, helping to prevent cyber-attacks or other security breaches in DePINs.

However, there are challenges to overcome. AI requires large amounts of data to train algorithms effectively, which may raise privacy concerns in DePINs. Additionally, ensuring the reliability and accuracy of AI systems in critical infrastructure is crucial. 

The integration of AI into DePINs holds promise for enhancing infrastructure management, but careful consideration of privacy, security, and reliability is essential.",CryptoCurrency,https://reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1bffkw7/intersection_of_depins_and_ai/,2024-03-15 10:43:37,0.08244434137291279,0.6347634508348794,0.016,0.175,0.9657

* “Require little knowledge, have low fees compared to traditional tokens, and have the potential to provide opportunities for investors to make quick profits.” 
* Have a *strong* relationship with their native networks
* Price performance is similar to a meme going viral on the internet.

ROI on cashback crypto cards," Hi r/CryptoCurrency  


Hear me out, my intend is not to shill anything to you. I'm just putting out an offering in the market which seems a no-brainer to me and I'm curious what y'all think about it and if there are other/even better offerings out there.

I want to present a clear overview to you about the value you can extract out of the CDC, Cronos VISA card program. CDC launched a new campaign in which new or upgrading card holders can receive a reimbursement (paid in CRO) on Apple products via the official website. The important sources to digest all benefits and terms & conditions are the [CDC Visa card program](https://crypto.com/cards) and the [(Limited Edition) Apple product campaign](https://crypto.com/product-news/cardapplepromo). 

To get a grasp of all benefits related to the card I quickly constructed a spreadsheet which calculates the return on your investment (ROI), to make it more comprehensive I provide you with the following example:

\- Imagine you are not yet familiar with CDC but you want to invest (more) into Crypto. Assumption 1: Let's say you want to invest $4000. Assumption 2: On average, you spend around $750 on groceries, clothes, leisure time activities, travelling, ... with the VISA card.

With $4000 dollar you can apply for the ""Royal Indigo & Jade Green"" Visa card. This Visa card tier will give you 2% cashback on all your expenses made with the card and around 4% staking rewards on your locked-up investment of CRO. Other rewards include a reimbursment of your Spotify and Netflix subscription for the first six months. With the Apple campaign, you also enjoy a reimbursement of $800 on Apple products, paid back in CRO.

[Example ROI ](https://preview.redd.it/0fm03igynhoc1.png?width=473&format=png&auto=webp&s=8aaa21aeb8dd306b0cd1bdcf799fecfa26df3066)

By filling in both the ""Royal Indigo & Jade Green"" Visa card with an average monthly expense pattern of $750 in the yellow cells, you end up with a Return of Investment of 32.52% on the $4000 dollars invested after 1 year. So, if CRO would hold the same price throughout the whole year, you will end up with a **risk-free profit of $1300 dollar** just by using the card and enjoying its benefits. The ROI is calculated on a one-year-basis + the calculated ROI will even be higher if you enjoy all benefits since I did not include Rewards+, Earn+, Expedia, AirBNB, Airport Lounge, Private Jet partnership, Welcome package, ... because of complexity reasons.

What do you guys think about such an offering and are there other offerings out there that I don't know about? Just trying to make informed decisions!

Please Help - Fire Token - Scam or Legit," **tl;dr: Is the crypto currency real and legit or just a snow ball system disguised by fancy words like blockchain, crypto token and real estate. This is not about investing... It is about preventing friends from doing somthing stupid !**

&#x200B;

Hey guys, I need the help of people that have a plan from crypto coins/ token and so on.

Quickly about the background: A friend of mine, lately came arround and toled me about Fire Token \[fire-token com\] and that he thinks those guys are cool and he will invest in it... since the money will not just end up in token, but in real estate. I looked it up and saw, they are investing in dubai. We both live in germany and he thought: those people are from germany, musst be legit. I looked up on the homepage and saw, they are based in dubai as well.

\~\~ 30 minutes research later \~\~

I figured out that once you are using those coins, you get more coins for recruiting new members.  
(found it on a youtube video by: Flo Pharell)

I also found somthing like a old / alternative homepage \[firetokenada com\], so I think.  
There is somthing writen about the Cardano blockchain.

Over all it looks very suspicious, straight up like a snow ball system disguised by fancy words like blockchain, crypto token and real estate.

But since I don't have any clue from blockchain and digital currencys, I could not figure out if this token is even real. On all the pages where I checked for the state of the coin, like CoinMarketCap or coinbase, I could not find any current value or graph / statistic that shows a status.

&#x200B;

**Help:**

Since I don't have an clue about blockchain currency trading, I thought I may ask the best community for such hot toppics.

1. Is the fire token even real?
2. How is the current value of the token?
3. does some one of you guys heard about that, has experience?
4. Is this a scam?

I tried to close the trade with the keyboard, but there were so many fucking options I was sifting through with tab that I was losing even more money while trying to do that.

I said fuck it and I raced to another room in my house where I had another battery and ran back to my PC, switched the battery and by the time the mouse was working again, my position was wiped out automatically. I was taken out by stop loss hunters. Those fucking cocksuckers took me out, but then the trade went in the direction I originally predicted any ways.

Buy now or wait for post-halving correction?,"So while this question is commonly reiterated in the sub, some factors are making me have a tough time predicting my next buy-in.

* Firstly, The ETFs are putting so much resistance and buy pressure on BTC and soon ETH that I'm wondering if we are even going to get a post-halving dip, or if the dip is going to reach lower levels than right now. Usually the halving promotes a large spike in price and historically whales then dump some liquidity after the halving, which causes a mass dip, and then buy back heavily causing a massive appreciation in the summer times. But when large companies such as BlackRock have to continuously buy btc to meet etf demand, we might have enough resistance to withhold a large dip.
* Secondly, we haven't even had any corrections this run-up so far. Usually, we see constant 20-30% dips even before halving, so far, BTC has been a stable appreciator, which in all honesty is unlike crypto. There's a possibility whales are bringing up consumer interest and demand to keep buying and then suddenly dump and liquidate all of those retail buyers. Im assuming that, that hasn't happened yet because there isn't that much retail in yet. Most of the recent price appreciation was due to the ETFs, so I'm assuming to expect the unexpected soon.
* Lastly, there's a strong BTC dominance going on right now, while there are some strong gains in meme coins and AI coins, so far altcoins have more or less been showing stable growth but nothing astronomical that we could expect in an alt season, hinting that the real run-up hasn't happened yet.

"Why I’m buying Litecoin, Doge and BCH","It is simple. All three coins are variations of bitcoin. Bitcoin is the best blockchain in the world, hands down, no questions asked. These variations can be seen as good or bad, but at the end of the day the main frame is the same and they all use proof of work.

If it's not proof of work it's not a commodity or a currency, it's a security. I am so tired of these centralized alt-coins pretending that they are a blockchain. They are a company that is selling you made up internet money. They might as well be Kohls offering Kohl's cash. It's junk.

Proof of work requires real world energy to create a token. That makes it REAL. If I am buying a currency I want it to be backed up by REAL world assets. Just like USD is backed up by real guns, tanks and jets. I don't want it to be backed up by ""validators"" aka venture capitalists who bought into some project early on and have full control of the protocol. That's what the stock market is for.

Another beautiful part of these 4 coins is that anyone can run a node. That is the true key to their decentralization. The consensus mechanism has two independent parts, nodes and miners. These two parts work in perfect harmony. Whereas a proof of stake chain like Ethereum simply has validators that vote on the future of the chain.

Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dogecoin and bitcoin cash are the main proof of work chains we have today and they will be around for ever in my opinion. All four are like a different model Mercedes. All serving different purposes.

I know a lot of bitcoin maxis don't think this way. But I think it's time that they do. At the end of the day proof of work is the genius behind bitcoin, and having multiple proof of work chains thrive is important.

I think all four will thrive! I cannot say the same about your favorite proof of stake coin.",CryptoCurrency,https://reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1bf02jo/why_im_buying_litecoin_doge_and_bch/,2024-03-14 19:56:12,0.16647509578544067,0.4840175150519978,0.022,0.161,0.9929

I Can't Get Aboard The AI and Gaming Narrative,"I understand that making money in this market requires following market trends and narratives, but why are AI and Gaming chains even a trend to begin with?

&#x200B;

Can someone tell me how AI enhances a blockchain, or how a blockchain enhances AI? I've seen one chain that claims that they'll reward people for GPU time that will be used to train AIs. Even if you had 10 of the highest-end consumer GPUs, that isn't shit. Those aren't designed for that task. Has anyone seen the tech that Microsoft uses to power ChatGPT? That's cutting edge advanced shit that you can't decentralize - it wouldn't be anywhere nearly as efficient as it is now. 

So what's the expectation here with AI? What are some niche use-cases for AI in this space? What has people excited?

&#x200B;

As for gaming, every single blockchain-based game I've seen dies quickly. There's no point to them. They don't need a blockchain. No one is buying those tokens to play the game - they're buying them to make money 

Again, what's the expectation here?

Meme Coins vs. Utility Tokens: The Battle for Crypto Supremacy,"Ever noticed how meme coins like DOGE and PEPE take over social media with their viral memes? It's like they're the life of the party, drawing attention and sparking short-term hype. But here's the deal: all that buzz can lead to wild value swings faster than you can say ""to the moon!""

Enter utility tokens like Chainlink. These bad boys are all about building solid infrastructures and unlocking real-world use cases. Sure, they might not have DOGE's meme power, but they're playing the long game—focusing on sustainable utility over fleeting trends. Now, let's get real about the risks. Meme coins are like that rollercoaster ride you can't resist, but sudden crashes are part of the deal. On the flip side, utility tokens like MorpheusNetwork offer a smoother, more stable investment journey.

Then there are new competitors, such as RWA tokens, digital tokens that represent ownership, or fractional ownership of tangible assets like real estate, commodities, and other tangibles. Landshare is a tokenized real estate platform that simplifies investments by offering RWA tokens. Investments can be as little as $50. The platform has successfully sold three tokenized real estate properties.

But here's the million-dollar question: do meme coins offer more than just social media hype?",CryptoCurrency,https://reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1bexkxb/meme_coins_vs_utility_tokens_the_battle_for/,2024-03-14 18:09:24,0.11577651515151514,0.4034217171717171,0.038,0.164,0.9791
This time is different. ,"I believe its way different, not only because we have the ETFs and the stock market being at an all time high. 


But we have multiple meme coins in the market, that are out preforming real projects. There's not much money rushing towards them, and that the real projects don't have anywhere to go until you forget about that project. 

We are also in the ""AI bubble"". Which has effected not only stocks, but it has definitely created a massive up hill cycle on Bitcoin and crypto.  

I'm not here to send fud, but remember to take Healty profits, a man never goes broke taking profits. But a man goes broke holding a bag for someone else. 

Bitcoin and crypto can be your best friend and your enemie.  (Just because it's your exit plan) it's not your kids or partners exit plan. 

Take profits before its to late. 

Also I'm bullish, just a friendly reminder to take profits even if it's not at the top.

"Memecoin ""catgirlcoin"". Take care"," 

Hello !

I have a bad feeling about the ""catgirlCoin"", like its hard being pump and dumped

First of all the link on coinmarketcap :

[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/catgirl/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/catgirl/)

The memecoin has been the ""most viewed"" coin for 30+days !!! Thats a very large amount. CMC is a website used a lot, there is no way that a single coin stays forever as the most viewed while being #790 as marketCap.

Two years ago, for their first big pump and dump, they had the same coin profile, as the historic say so :  
[https://np.reddit.com/r/catgirlcoin/comments/ru4m7c/most\_viewed\_coin/](https://np.reddit.com/r/catgirlcoin/comments/ru4m7c/most_viewed_coin/)

[https://np.reddit.com/r/catgirlcoin/comments/qtmd4f/trending\_most\_viewed/](https://np.reddit.com/r/catgirlcoin/comments/qtmd4f/trending_most_viewed/)

This conversation about suspicion of pump and dump feels overealist :

[https://np.reddit.com/r/catgirlcoin/comments/17jzdk4/convince\_me\_this\_is\_not\_a\_pump\_and\_dump/](https://np.reddit.com/r/catgirlcoin/comments/17jzdk4/convince_me_this_is_not_a_pump_and_dump/)

And look at the bscscan :  
[https://bscscan.com/token/0x79ebc9a2ce02277a4b5b3a768b1c0a4ed75bd936#tokenAnalytics](https://bscscan.com/token/0x79ebc9a2ce02277a4b5b3a768b1c0a4ed75bd936#tokenAnalytics)  
I feel like it has weird transfer amount / value ratio around pump.

How can this coin have so much ""most visited"" on CMC for so long ?

Anyone else feel relief from the current drop?,"I have been looking at all this crypto green like I would a balloon my kids are pumping up way past safe size.

I was waiting to see it pop and now that it has deflated somewhat I damn happy because it flushed out leverage and provided a good reality check on how bubbly it all is.

It seems to me that its not yet as bubbly as I had feared and that this balloon might still have more space to get pumped.

A five to ten percent drop is not much for crypto as such, but its was a needed little cleanup and test as far as I am concerned.

The way up should better be intercepted every week or two by some corrections of this size just to check out how stable our foundation is.

EU country leveraging Quantum Resistance.  Ethereum board member Patrick Storchenegger  and Qanplatform partners in the deal,"The quantum narrative continues to heat up.  Patrick Storchenegger is a listed Ethereum foundation board member.

Note- this doesn't imply the public blockchain will be used, which is moving to final testing in a few weeks.  Perhaps use of the Privatenet, or just use of key implementations (Patrick is the CEO of QAN’s Intellectual Property (IP) holding company).

Majority of crypto investors don't do research but 'invest' in empty promises and hype (example),"I've been in the crypto space for many years and always keeping my eyes open for interesting projects. And when I find a project  I dedicate countless hours to evaluating it, understanding its intricacies, and ensuring its trustworthiness. However, I feel like the majority of crypto investors are more drawn to hype and empty promises rather than doing their due diligence and investing in projects with real substance. Allow me to illustrate this point with (one of many) a recent comparison I came across.  In this example I have removed the names of the projects as I do not wish to credit or discredit one of the projects. It is just an example to make my point.

# Project A vs. Project B

**Project A**

Let's start with Project A. This project has a really great looking and flashy website (kudos to them as it honestly looks amazing), a promising whitepaper, and a laundry list of ambitious plans. They talk about everything from crypto payment gateways to debit cards and DeFi wallets. Sounds great, right? Well, yes, but they haven't released anything yet. The first release mentioned on their whitepaper with an actual utility is Q1 2025. Their final release, and perhaps the most important one (a crypto payment gateway) is being released in Q3 2026. Moreover, their promises include features like crypto debit cards with cashback and without KYC, which is already quite a challenge in today's regulatory landscape. Even more concerning considering they are being released in Q4 2025, when more regulation could be expected. Maybe if there was a great team behind it, it could gain some trust from me. But to top it off, the owners aren't even KYC! For me, this is a major red flag, and the project seems too good to be true. However, it has already raised over 30 million dollars in pre-sales with a starting MCap at launch of $150 million!

**Project B**

Now, let's turn our attention to Project B. This project may not have the flashy marketing yet and could be greatly improved, but what it does have is substance. Project B is a 2.5 year old project that's already achieved significant milestones. Unlike Project A, Project B already has a working crypto payment gateway processing millions a month, sells crypto debit cards (virtual & physical), offers crypto gift cards, and has a IOS & Android app currently in beta that includes the before mentioned utilities + DeFi and (soon) CeFi wallets. The team behind Project B is fully KYC and have been featured in many podcasts, ama's, etc.

**The Revelation (of MCap)**

Here's the kicker – despite Project B's achievements, its market cap is significantly lower than Project A's with around $20 million. So what Project A promises to have ready in 2025-2026 is almost completely developed by Project B already, but their MCap is 7x as low. It's mind-boggling to see how investors flock to projects like Project A, driven solely by hype and (empty) promises with a risk as the owners are not KYC, while projects like Project B, which actually deliver on their promises, are undervalued and overlooked. Yes, project B should invest more in marketing, but there is also the task for investors to do proper research.

This contrast between hype-driven investments and projects with substance highlights that the majority of crypto investors aren't doing their research. Instead, they're blindly following the crowd, chasing the next big thing without stopping to question its legitimacy. They do not actively search for new projects, but wait for the new projects to come to them. Let's shift our focus from hype to substance. Let's do our research and invest in projects that truly deserve our support.

What are your thoughts on this issue? What examples of this have you found? I'd love to hear your perspective.

**TL;DR:**

In my years in crypto, I've noticed most investors prioritize hype over substance. Take Projects A and B as examples: A, with its $150M pre-sale, hasn't delivered anything yet, while B, with only a $20M market cap, has already achieved almost everthing Project A promises to achieve in 2025-2026. This disparity highlights the need for investors to prioritize substance over hype and conduct thorough research before investing.",CryptoCurrency,https://reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1bes26l/majority_of_crypto_investors_dont_do_research_but/,2024-03-14 14:22:52,0.21455095450997086,0.495016322475339,0.027,0.177,0.9991

How do I determine how much tax to take out if I make partial sells and reinvest? ,"Guys I’m not super good at the maths.  With all my investing I’ve been a buy and hold type of person. I accumulated in the bear market, and Im not one to be bouncing around taking profits and reinvesting.  I did do that with one coin, as I thought I could make more putting those profits into 3 other coins.  Most all of my others I’m leaving until it’s time to sell and cash out.  
But, how do you figure out how much capital gains comes out if you want to sell a partial position and reinvest?  
Or do you just leave it and use a software like coin tracker at the end of the year for tax?
Part of my initial strategy was to make a quick flip in Filecoin and buy into Cardano, which I did, but I am making it a habit of taking capital gains out before I reinvest in case shit goes south and I lose it all.  It also sounds nightmare-ish going back at the end of the year and figuring everything out.  Unless I just subtract my total invested from my gains at the end? But I’d rather just do it now.

Preferred crypto wallet? Hot or cold?,"Hi everyone

After seeing so many posts about people’s Coinbase accounts being breached and Coinbase jut having some technical difficulties in the past month or two, I’ve decided I have too much worth losing on my Coinbase account to not switch into a wallet.

I’ve heard Ledger and Trezor are both pretty good, however I have a couple points I’m wondering about:

1. If I plan on selling some of my coins after this bull market (so anywhere from 8-18 months from now) should I look into a cold wallet or a hot wallet?

2. I have multiple coins aside from btc, namely eth, sol, and ada. Would Trezor or Ledger be good wallets to store (and eventually sell off) these coins in?

3. I obviously want the most amount of protection/security for a wallet, and I’ve seen many suggestions as to how to ensure that. I’d like to avoid having the wallet on my phone, as Ive seen people recommend that can be easily breached. Does that mean I should buy an old laptop, disconnect it from the internet and use that to install a wallet on? Or buy a ledger wallet usb thing from Best Buy? If anybody has a good resource or guide on ensuring wallet security that’s be awesome.

Thanks in advance!",CryptoCurrency,https://reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1bensu5/preferred_crypto_wallet_hot_or_cold/,2024-03-14 11:25:27,0.30104166666666665,0.5160416666666665,0.029,0.177,0.9862
Developer Royalty Fees- thoughts?,"
Has anyone seen this concept used anywhere else, or being considered?  It is a powerful concept for sure, and since it involves payouts when contracts are called, seems very achievable.  What are your thoughts?


""Developers (Generic Smart Contract Developers) whose code will be re-used will be rewarded after:
Each new smart contract deployment fee is paid by Specific Smart Contract Developers.

All transactions which interact with smart contracts (DApps) where the code is re-used.

The reward is for a lifetime.


Developers can cut their smart contract upload costs by 80%
QANplatform’s Developer Royalty System reduces burden on the network since only new code logic parts will be uploaded on the QAN MainNet. As a result of this, Specific Smart Contract Developers who re-use already deployed code parts in their smart contracts pay proportionately less, since they only pay for the new code parts to be deployed on the blockchain. ""


This will be part of the upcoming testnet V3 according to the roadmap,  so we'll get to see how it works.   Seems like a great way to encourage ecosystem development.

The numbers: Here's how El Salvador is doing. How much they have. How much they gained. The strategy they used. How they would have done with different strategies. And the lesson this provides for DCA.,"In 2021, El Salvador's President (\*cough\* dictator \*cough\*) started to buy bags of Bitcoin. He did it in several seemingly random buys that he announced on Twitter.

Starting in September with two batches of 200 coins.

Then about 8 batches at random times between September 2021 and November 2022. Each batch between 20-500 Bitcoin with no rhyme or reason in the amount or timing.

But then on November 17, 2022, he finally decided to DCA properly and simply buy 1 Bitcoin a day.

**The numbers:**

&#x200B;

* The average acquisition cost was about **42.6K** per Bitcoin.
* It cost El Salvador about **$129.9 M** to acquire their 2,862 BTC.
* Today, those 2,862 Bitcoin are worth **$203M**.
* That's **$73M** in unrealized gains in 2.5 years.
* That's about **56%** in portfolio gains.
* Bitcoin is currently up **458%** from its bear market lowest dip in 2022.
* El Salvador bought their Bitcoins unevenly with a bigger concentration in 2021 and early 2022.
* If El Salvador had bough everything at once on their first day, they would be up by a little less, about 50% instead of 56%.
* If they had properly DCA'd equally every month, the average acquisition cost would have been **$31,500** instead of $42,600.
* If they had DCA'd equally every month, they would have been up about **79%** instead of 56%.
* If Bitcoin were to hit $100K, their portfolio would be worth **$286M**.

Enjoy the graph I made!,"This is a graph I made today while I was procrastinating doing my actual work :)

You could model this portfolio valuation in different ways, but this is how I chose to construct it:

1. It finds the all-time high for each respective token (bounded by \[1-Jan-21 to 1-Jan-23\]);
2. It DCA's $100 every Tuesday until the current day;
3. The plot tracks the historical portfolio value;
4. The legend annotates several metrics:

* \# of Tokens;
* End-Date Book Value;
* End-Date Portfolio Value;
* Cumulative Return.

This chart will look very different as the months progress and if I remember, I'll update it occasionally. 

Enjoy.

No opportunities arose as the market moved to winter and I have just held and watched since.

How to Not Be a Crypto Bagholder: Advice on Avoiding Shills,"**Don't listen to crypto shills**

The crypto world is full of people who will try to tell you what to invest in. They'll shill their favorite coins, post idiotic charts, and promise you lambos. But before you listen to them, remember one thing: they don't have a magic crystal ball.

The truth is, no one knows for sure what the future of crypto holds. Anyone who tells you otherwise is either trying to sell you something or they're delusional.

So, what should you do? Here are a few tips:

* **Do your own research.** Don't just blindly follow what someone else tells you. Read whitepapers, research the team, and look at the community.
* **Be skeptical.** If something sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Don't be afraid to question people's motives.
* **Remember that crypto is a risky investment.** Only invest what you can afford to lose.

Here are some additional points to consider:

* **Shills are often biased.** They may have a vested interest in the coin they're promoting, so they're not likely to give you an objective opinion.
* **Charts can be misleading.** It's easy to make a chart look bullish or bearish, but that doesn't mean it's an accurate representation of the future.
* **Past performance is not indicative of future results.** Just because a coin has gone up in the past doesn't mean it will continue to go up in the future.

The crypto world is a wild place, but it's also an exciting one. There's a lot of potential for profit, but there's also a lot of risk. So, before you invest, make sure you do your own research and don't listen to the shills.

Is alt season a self fulfilling prophecy or just hopium?,"So i am wondering what do you think about the belief there will be an alt season? 🤔 
I would like to see crypto developing in more ways but development does not necessarily mean profit right? For example Polygon is a cool project and has low fees but is it really a good investment? Some people say no but what do you think about alts? Wich are there just for support and wich are valuable investment opportunities?

Compared to other crypto btc is clearly dominating the market hard but i saw people discussing here about why the cycle is repeating and an alt season is unavoidable. As far as i am concerned I am skeptical about a certainty in any investment.

[Serious] Actually fully open source wallet?,"So I've been trying to look for a fully open source wallet that doesn't only support bitcoin... and am struggling. I'd like a wallet that I can fully self audit and verify both circuit wise and firmware wise.

I've identified the following so far:

BTC Only

* Blockstream Jade
* Seedsigner
* Keepkey

Open source software/firmware but not hardware

* BitBox
* KeepKey
* Keystone
* Onekey
* Dcent
* Safepal
* Satochip
* Tangem

Fully closed wallets

* Coolwallet
* Ellipal
* SecuX
* Arculus

Then there's ledger... do i even have to say anything about ledger?  


The only real contenders i found were:

Trezor - Requires lots of fine SMT soldering, one person said it took them \~10 hours to make a single one by hand

Prokey - Looks to be all open source, but requires a $500 a month subscription to export production files

REQ will still be around years from now because it is something that 'normies' not into crypto can benefit from.,"When I look at most of these crypto startups, meme coins, etc... most of them require you to buy tokens, set up a wallet, go to an exchange, etc. **One thing that Apple has shown us, is that most people want simplicity.** Most people may dabble in Bitcoin/LTC/ETH at the most, but I still can't see everyday Joe-sick pack with a huge portfolio of coins.

The 1000's of coins that exist, is just too overwhelming for mainstream society. Who has time to research all of this? Satoshi's vision was to have a decentralized platform that anyone can use in the world, for very low fee's.

Unfortunately Bitcoin is no longer that, it's more of a store of wealth. REQ is simple, elegant, doesn't require you to go on exchanges or setup a wallet. You just send/accept a request, save money on fee's and all of the blockchain action is encapsulated from the end user. **Add in the fact that Request just announced that they are fiat friendly, which is a killer app for Request.** This is why I feel Request will still be around once most of these alt's come and go.

Not to mention their partners with Deloitte, PwC, acquisition of Consola, quikbooks integration, and much more. 

TL;DR - **I can see my Mom and Dad using Request to send money, buy things on Amazon, etc before I can see them setting up a wallet and buying cryptocurrencies on exchanges.** Unlike most alt's, Request has a very low barrier for entry.  It's something that serves the crypto community as well as the 'normies' (everyone else).

What will be the next crypto ETF?,"The bitcoin ETFs have been wildly successful so far. Will there be more crypto ETFs in the near future? If so, what coins will be next? 

What will be the biggest obstacles for another crypto ETF? 

I think it will come down to the SECs decision on what cryptos are securities and which cryptos are commodities. In my opinion, I think coins that are commodities will become ETFs. It would be very difficult to create an ETF for unregistered securities. 

This brings me to my next question. What cryptos other than bitcoin will be considered commodities by the SEC? Will all proof of work coins be considered commodities? Like, Litecoin, Dogecoin, Bitcoin Cash, or Monero.

I think the SEC will also consider other factors like how the coin was initially released and how the consensus mechanism works.

Bitget Eth deposit on wrong network,"Hello,

I found myself in a very sad situation in which I am fully responsible.

I made an large ETH deposit from MM to Bitget on the ZK era network address, but instead used the Linea. I did a first small deposit, everything went well, but the other one I forgot to change network.

Well needless to say I am alone in my mistake now, and not feeling well about it at all. I usually do not rush things in crypto but it looks like I did this time and it was a costly mistake for which I may not recover financially anytime soon. I try to stay composed.

I have written to Bitget already and awaiting an answer but realistically what can be done? 

I see that the Eth deposit address is the same no matter the network, but the website doesn’t take in charge Linea. Does it mean if it ever does, the ETH will show then in my account? Also they Bitget wallet takes Linea, sadly not their website.

Hedging high-risk short positions with longs,"
Meme coins are beginning to go wild and the euphoria's everywhere. Some coins like pepe and floki are up nearly 1,000% in the last 30 days

Anyone who has been in the crypto space long enough should know that the likelihood of these values to come crashing right back down to what they were before the run-up is extreme.

So, logically, one should be thinking about shorting them right? Well, problem with that is these coins could easily still go up a few Xs before their inevitable crash. So your shorts could easily get liquidated before the crash happens. 

But what if there's a way to protect yourself from these liquidations while still maintaining a strong short position? 

As is, if I have 10k to risk and I open a short with it on PEPE and the market crashes hard over the coming days, I'd stand to gain at least 5x on that position. That's an easy 50k. But it's risky because if PEPE doubles over the coming days then I lose 10k unless I keep adding to my position, but there's only so many times a person can afford to double their position, and then you stand to lose a whole lot more. 

So here's what I'm thinking instead. Take that 10k and put half of it short PEPE and half of it long. If the market completely dumps, you lose your 5k long but he's down to gain a 5x or more on your 5K short. So yeah, your gains are half as big as they could have been but you're also protected on the upside. So let's say the market doesn't dump right away and pepe instead does another 2x. Now, your 5k short will have been liquidated so that's gone. But you're up 5k on your long. So overall, minus the fees of course, you are pretty much back to where you started at 10k. Now take the 5K profit from the long and open up a new short position. Rinse and repeat until the inevitable crash.

Of course, this can only work with shit coins that have had insane run-ups in a short time. With anything else, you'll end up canceling most of your gains with your hedges. And obviously you would need to find coins that also have the futures contracts.

But it's more likely that none of this will work anyway because it just can't be that easy and I am a buffoon who has completely overlooked some major flaws in this strategy. Please educate me before I make some bad decisions.

Announcing Partnerships with Celer and Camelot to Bridge and Trade MOON on Arbitrum One,"**Moons are now bridgeable to ETH mainnet and Arbitrum one via Arbitrum’s official bridge!** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/svrrelvu76oc1.png?width=445&format=png&auto=webp&s=a8d9c63d9a623419f7d25b6c30fbc0b5a84ea673

To clarify this is **not a migration**, but rather a **two-way bridge**. If you wish to keep your Moons on Arbitrum nova that is perfectly fine, and as of now exchanges only support deposits on Arbitrum nova.

As a warning this is somewhat technically intensive for the uninitiated and requires ETH on Arbitrum nova, mainnet, and Arbitrum one to complete. **Two mainnet transactions are required**, one to claim Moons on mainnet and another to bridge Moons from mainnet to Arbitrum one.  

\*\*\*

**Instructions:**

1. Go to bridge.arbitrum.io (double check the URL on your screen matches)

2. Select Nova to Ethereum 

3. Select token, enter Moons contract on Arbitrum nova: 0x0057Ac2d777797d31CD3f8f13bF5e927571D6Ad0

4. Approve and bridge

7 days later

5. Claim the Moons on Ethereum 

6. Select networks, Ethereum to ONE

7. Select token and Enter Ethereum Moons contract, (https://etherscan.io/address/0xb2490e357980ce57bf5745e181e537a64eb367b1) approve and bridge

8. Wait few minutes and claim the Moons on ONE

\*\*\*

Unfortunately **this bridge takes 7 days to complete**, and given mainnet **gas fees** have to be paid twice it likely will not make sense for small dollar amounts of Moons to be transferred through the official bridge.

Thankfully **on March 20th Celer protocol** will be supporting moons via a pools model to allow for users to **bridge moons directly between Arbitrum nova and Arbitrum one** without having to wait a week. Celer is also providing incentives for bridge LPs: 285,000 Celer tokens will be distributed over the first 60 days the bridge is live.

When was the first time you bought crypto and what was it?,"Now that we’ve reached all time highs, I’m curious to know when was the first time you bought crypto and what was it?

For myself, I simultaneously bought ETH, ADA and BTC in 2020 and been holding ever since. It’s crazy to see the all time highs but for the veterans here, we’ve seen these bull runs many times to only see a nasty pullback that turns people away.  

If you’re reading this question and haven’t bought any crypto yet, I suggest continue to research and ensure you know what you’re getting into and how much you’re willing to either lose or handle. Large dips are as common as big green candles and seeing your port down 50% is normal over the years.

Developers: Avoid TonCoin and TonFoundation,"Hello,

I'm a TON Developer. I am here to warn any developers who want to get in to the TON Ecosystem.

The community moderation is rampant with lack of professionalism, children, and admin abuse. After investing time and effort into learning about the TON ecosystem, and the many complexities it has - I landed in the TON Developer EN and RU chats. After talking on the chat for an hour - mostly exchanging knowledge with other programmers, I was banned from the chat with absolutely no explanation, warning, message, or appeal recourse. I only found out about it because I couldn't find the TON developer group anymore.  The documentation needs a lot of work, and you have to rely on the community for guidance. So getting cut off from the groups means that as a developer, you are entirely on your own. The admins offer vague reasons, and you have to appeal to them on a personal level to get reinstated. It is up to the discretion of random people that they gathered together whether you should be allowed in the group or not. There is no formal process, no community guidelines, no appeal process - nothing. AVOID the Ton ecosystem, it is very immature yet and needs a lot of work.

&#x200B;

Ton NEEDS developers. It is a system that relies almost ENTIRELY on developers. But developers are treated like disposable garbage, and nobody seems to care. I think this is the end of my journey with TON, and I think a lot of people should read this before considering joinin the TON ecosystem.

&#x200B;

If anyone from the TON Foundation is reading this, I will be happy to provide more details about what happened so that you can improve the product. I originally liked the idea of TON, but this experience put me off from using it entirely",CryptoCurrency,https://reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1bdwsdu/developers_avoid_toncoin_and_tonfoundation/,2024-03-13 13:08:42,0.1546875,0.628125,0.065,0.072,0.8823

Can someone please help me figure out how to use Uniswap I'm so lost.,"Hi! I've been into crypto for about a year and a half now, and I want to start getting more into it,  buying smaller shitcoins and stuff lol. The only issue is, I don't know how to use Uniswap for the life of me. 

When I try to convert 100 USDC to ETH it says I don't have enough ETH to cover the network cost, but it only shows $4.27 for gas fees. (Both have a little Arbitrum logo next to it and I have no clue why or how to change it)

When I try to send ETH to my Coinbase wallet it only lets me send $30 worth not the full $90 I have.

When I try to send my 100USDC back to Coinbase it says I don't have enough ETH to cover the network cost, but then it says the network cost is $1.06 with the Arbitrum logo next to it.

Can someone please help me figure this out?? I really don't want to lose $200 like this. I think the main issue is that I sent the USDC to my Uniswap account through Arbitrum, and now I can't use it with anything related to ETH, how can I get this USDC & ETH either back on my Coinbase account without BS fees, or how I can bridge my USDC to be ETH?

Followed up shortly with; why did this company pay you on these dates (My Employer)

1. How do I sell these? Do I have to move them out of my wallet and on to for example [crypto.com](https://crypto.com) and sell then them?
2. I heard horror stories come tax time. People sell for a loss but yet the IRS thinks that you made gains. I no longer remember my cost average as overtime I purchased more coins to dollar cost average. (im sure I am at a loss still). Will [crypto.com](https://crypto.com) know my average (even for coins I purchased from Uphold)? How do I calculate everything to see what I really loss?

What is the point of Layer 2's on top of Ethereum?,"I don't really get the point of L2s. They're supposed to help Ethereum scale, right? But at the same time the user experience is like using an entirely different network anyway. You have to set up a totally new RPC endpoint in Metamask/whatever wallet so why not just make different scalable L1s that have nothing to do with Ethereum at that point? I just don't understand what the point is of complicating things by requiring Ethereum as a base layer.

If the point is to inherit Eth's level of security by periodically settling transaction batches on it, then I still don't get why these exist. If these were separate L1's and they got popular enough for it to matter, they would still easily attain sufficient security through a large number of miners or validators.

Bitcoin and AI,"Hi. I was thinking about the future of bitcoin and AI, and I thunked up a spooky idea.  What if bitcoin is the main tool that AI can use to control us?

Here’s my chain of thinking…

Bitcoin uses a lot of energy, and so does data centers that power AI (it’s one of the main future constraints). These may be seen as a competitors for energy, however perhaps they actually enable and measure one another. AI compute will be exchanged for bitcoin, and bitcoin will be exchanged for AI compute. AI needs physical energy for its digital work, and bitcoin is the mechanism for AI to exchange its digital work for physical work. 

Here’s how it will start….bitcoin will at first be used to add electrical load buffer to the data centers and the electrical grid, as we are seeing in Texas.  This will make data centers more robust and flexible. And, AI developers will also find it useful to make and receive payments by bitcoin (maybe the lightning network) because payments are nearly instant and irreversible, which is critical for fast speed AI business. Further, bitcoin will also capture the appreciating economic productivity gains of AI because it’s a deflationary currency. This makes it perfect for AI to hold as a store of value for itself. Additionally, governments and militaries will find it important to mine bitcoin and hold bitcoin, so in the event of a war, they can use the bitcoin to pay miners to transfer energy to the data centers to compute critical military AI calculations. 

All of this is bullish for bitcoin and the price going up.


However, now if you imagine AI becoming evil, where it becomes used as a means of centralization and control, this could be possible through bitcoin. Because bitcoin is a way where digital work from AI can be exchanged for physical work of bitcoin mining and physical energy, it represents a way in which AI can exchange its digital work for control and ownership upon the physical world. At first I imagined a scenario where some renegade AI developer programs their AI to influence and manipulate humans, and then controls their overall social behavior. However, now I can further imagine where a rogue AI program can become wealthy by accruing its own bitcoin, business power, and bribe human officials through bitcoin payments. This was not as likely under the fiat system because the control of fiat was largely centralized with the central banks and governments. But now, bitcoin is a decentralized currency, and the threat of a centralized and corrupt AI could leverage bitcoin for its own nefarious means.

Question about dice roll security,"I just created several keys using 50 dice rolls for 12 word seed phrases with Seedsigner.

I thought to myself that there's actually quite a lot of difference between using 50 dice rolls (12 words) and 99 dice rolls (24 words) as far as possible combinations go, and ran the numbers.

Here's the difference:

`6^50 (12 words):`  
`808281277464764060643139600456536293376`  
`6^99 (24 words):`  
`108886437250011817682781711193009636756190618412159145257178661061582856912896`  
`2^160 (BTC max addresses) 160bit:`  
`1461501637330902918203684832716283019655932542976`  
`2^128 (128bit):`  
`340282366920938463463374607431768211456`  
`10^78 (atoms in the universe):`  
`1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000`

How are 12 words considered secure then when it's so much less than 160bit? I read that something gets stored as 128bit numbers. 128bit is actually less than 50 dice rolls, so that would make at least some sense.

And how come that 160bit is actually so much less than the number of atoms in the universe? I was always told that there are more addresses than atoms.

State of multi-sig hardware wallets,"Someone close to me recently got their house broken into and their seed phrase stolen from their safe. This got me thinking about the single point of failure of today's devices.

A multi-sig solution is paramount I believe for any serious cold-storage. I've looked at Bitkey's implementation but am not at all happy with the compromises today: 

 [A few questions before purchasing : r/BitkeyWallet (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitkeyWallet/comments/1blptgk/a_few_questions_before_purchasing/) 

 [Block's Bitkey ""Hardware Wallet"" will Violate your Privacy and Security (zherbert.com)](https://www.zherbert.com/bitkey/) 

Is there a company that does multi-sig hardware wallets correctly? Ideally: 

1. 2-of-4 multisig where 1 code lives on a hardware device, 1 offline on paper, 1 on a connected device (phone/pc) and 1 at a friend's place. This allows for security and recovery options. 2 codes needed for a transaction or to recover any other code.
2. No cloud service for privacy.
3. Ease of use with mobile app + hardware device.
4. Open source mobile/desktop app
5. A hardware device with a screen to not depend on the internet connected device for security
6. Ideally air gapped device.
7. Ability to export all keys so no company/app dependencies in case they go out of business.

Anything like this around?

Mixing KYC with non KYC," Sorry if this is a stupid question, I took a look at some similarly titled ones and couldn't find an answer. I’ve been buying up BTC since 2021, and throughout that time, the majority of my Bitcoin has been bought through exchanges with KYC - either coinbase or a Singapore based one called Onus. I’m from the UK and currently an expat living abroad in Southeast Asia. During this time I was initially buying on coinbase through my UK bank account. 

After a while I wanted to buy some BTC with some of my money abroad, but I had issues with most exchanges that were blocked by my local bank. Eventually I was able work out how to buy P2P (also with KYC) through Onus. Before I figured this out however, I asked a friend of a friend out here to send me about £1000 worth of USDT and I transferred the money to his bank account. I exchanged this for Bitcoin and I transferred it to my trust wallet, where it mixed with my KYC Bitcoin .. did I make a mistake here?

I’ve become worried that now if I ever try to sell in the UK through coinbase, it could all get blocked / frozen if they can’t trace the origin of some of it. Would they freeze the non KYC and let me have the rest, or would I be okay? I’m not sitting on masses here, around 0.12 total. It’s also worth mentioning that a lot of the Bitcoin I bought through Onus, I sent to kucoin to exchange because the fees were lower - and this was before kucoin had KYC.

Moving BTC off Ledger (sat / byte vs sat / vbyte),"So I'm in the process of moving funds to a different wallet from Ledger Live.

Ledger Live quotes the fee in sat / byte. Currently it's saying for a low transaction fee I have to pay 26 sat / byte however I can submit a custom fee.

The bitcoin in my current wallet have are all stored in addresses starting with 'bc1' (i.e. segwit I assume)

On [bitcoinfees.net](https://bitcoinfees.net) it's currently saying a fee of 15 sat / vbyte will take about 20 mins.

I don't fully understand the difference between sat / vbyte vs sat / byte and the last thing I want is for the transaction to get stuck. For the purposes of moving funds to the new wallet can I assume sat / vbyte is analogous to sat / byte in my case? I.e can I go to advanced on Ledger Live and select say 15 sat / byte and it's likely to adhere to the 20 mins according to bitcoinfees or can I not make that assumption.

How Often Do Y’all Check the Price of Bitcoin,"A BTC noob here and I hope I’m accepted. I only just recently invested in the ETF, and don’t plan (for now) on ever holding any BTC on an exchange or a cold wallet. I do however think that making a substantial investment in my Roth should pay dividends. A few observations:

Contrary to what my friends and families would have had me believe, my account did not plummet to zero a few days after buying. It’s been a trip watching these large swings (albeit most likely smallish from a historical perspective) in my brokerage account.

A few questions:

-How often do you check the value of BTC? On the large green days it’s so much fun to root for and watch. 
-How do you manage the high highs and low lows for a mental POV? 
-Is everyone here a HODLer or do many people take profits? 
-If you’re in an ETF, is there a set point where taking profits is advisable in a tax privileged account or should I just set it and forget it like my total market funds. 

Also wondering if you have any podcasts or YouTubers that are actually worth following.

Old wallet help,"I've searched and most posts are for wallets with seed phrases, which doesn't apply here.

Noob questions,"I am pretty new to bitcoin investing. I started about a year ago on Robinhood (since then I’ve been reading it’s not a great option). I recently bought a Trezor but am waiting for it to be delivered (should be here Monday). My plan is to HODL which is why I bought it. I was going to try and transfer to a hot wallet (any recommendations for best one would be appreciated) but at this point feel like it’s kind of pointless with the Trezor coming on Monday.

I have a few questions:

1. Am I able to transfer btc directly to my Trezor or do I need to use another service like a hot wallet?

2. Are there fees to make a transfer to a cold wallet?

3.  I am planning on setting up the cash app direct deposit to DCA to avoid fees. I understand it’s recommended to transfer to cold wallet once you have a good amount of sats. Can you transfer directly from cash app to Trezor? What would be the recommendation of the amount of sats to save in cash app before putting on cold wallet? 

4. Since most people aren’t a fan of buying on Robinhood (high fees I think?), would Kraken be a better option when buying larger amounts? Or just stick to cash app? Specifically I’m talking about when I have an extra lump sum of money to invest. My understanding of the way you avoid fees buying on cash app is having a direct deposit set up and getting paid partially in btc. 

5. Sort of a tax related question if anyone has any idea… I had bought a good amount about a year ago and planned to sell at $60k. I ended up selling at $55k because I got scared then regretted the choice and bought everything back. This was really stupid because I ended up losing money with the Robinhood fees and now I’m wondering if I will have to pay taxes on my gains (even though I reinvested right back into btc the next day). Anyone had something similar happen or know if paying taxes on that money is a thing?

The goal was always 1 BTC but I made some big mistakes with leverage on BTC back in 2021… expensive lessons were learned. No more leverage for me. Although MSTR could be considered leverage.

Mining Bitcoin with Poop,"I was reading about the Omni-processor which converts human waste into drinking water plus electricity. I learned the best models can generated 250 kw of electricity which is enough to generate .15 bitcoin per day.

It seems to me that this would be a great way to promote Bitcoin mining in the continents of Africa as well as India because both regions have major sanitation problems. The local could get clean water and they would have an incentive to collect poop and feed it to the generator cuz it would generate bitcoin which would provide jobs to the local economy while promoting Bitcoin.

I can't see the downside but I'm wondering why no one is doing this yet? Seems to me that if we can turn our shit into jobs & bitcoin everyone would win.

Bitcoin Power Law model,"You can Google ""Bitcoin Power Law"" or search on  YouTube or use MS Copilot to get more details but I find this to be an interesting model.

It isn't meant to be used for day trading (it's not that specific) but I think it might be helpful to look ahead over the next 20 years (with all the caveats implied with forecasting the future).

It projects a price along with a support price and a resistance price which is basically one standard deviation so you have a price, double the price for the resistance and half the price for the support price.

It shows the greatest absolute gains between year 10 and year 20. It shows declining percentage gains with it currently gaining (as I recall) about 45%, going to the 30% range at year 10 and 19% at year 20.

I could be helpful just planning ahead, it could also put the blow off tops in perspective and give a clue as to how long it's likely to go at any point in time.

You can also plug the formula into an Excel spreadsheet. The formula is Price = 10\^-17 \* (days since Genesis block in Jan 3, 2009...current figure is 5557)\^5.8.

It basically shows a price of about $100k by the end of 2025 with resistance at $200k and support at $50k. That's for one standard deviation. In the past it has gone to 2 standard deviations for short periods of time (again, as I recall).

Those figures would be in line with what has occurred in the past. Maybe this time is a little different with the spot ETF so maybe the numbers are moved earlier. Usually the ATH occurs after the halving and the peak usually happens 12-18 months after the halving. That would put it toward the end of 2025.

Some say that this time all that might occur by the end of the year (2024) and that there might be a crash next year. I tend to think that next year will still be a good year even if this year is a good year as well.

You'll see that $1,000,000 Bitcoin could happen by 2028 and will ""never"" get below $1,000,000 after 2037.

Bitcoin is not something you need faith in to invest. You need to research it to trust it, all info are available to all citizens without discrimination.

FIATs are built, controlled and accessible to an elite that chooses for you. But the people have no say, no amount of research will allow you to know what they do to it. You need faith in your country's leaders and that is it.

Knowing all this can we agree that FIATs are a religion and Bitcoin is the real money?

could access to bitcoin be restricted?,"I have been in this sub for quite a while and reading the posts seems like mass adoption is on it's way. I used to think that too, btc is like gold but 10× better: why would anyone not want to use it? 

But then, yesterday while trying to sleep, the mass adoption narrative started appearing to me like a fairy tale. If btc really became of global use the elites and governments would start seeing it as a very big threat.

What would stop the elites from taking an unitary action and banning all popular means of acquiring btc? (i am talking about an aperation between the biggest nations) The market really depends on the very big exanges (such as coinbase, binance etc.). The regual Joe when trying to buy some sats the first thing he does is signing up to an exange. But what if all exanges were banned, or access to it restricted? Would the mass adoption narrative still be possible?

Picture milions upon milions of people trying to buy btc; i think that very big exanges (with thousands of btc to sell and very big servers) would be necessary for mass adoption. Or think about where would you sell your btc if those services were restricted or banned.

Of course there would still be means of acquiring/selling btc, maybe using a vpn, maybe using the dark web or even P2P; but that's not something the regular joe knows how to do, the regular joe does not want to get into truble with the government. Also, let's all remember also how governments decided they didn't want nuclear power, and every one went whith it, or how they went with killing millions just beacuse of the sake of it; my point is that masses are really easly manipulable. 

So, my question being, if the elites decided they had enough, would they be able to prohibit people from acquiring btc in an efficent way (taking into account good part of the population using the service)?

3. I've been told I cannot use the funds/BTC sitting in the account to pay any fees. The funds for fees have to be added to the account separately. The do not have anything posted to their site with this information, they just send it by email after I try to do it. Why would they have such a rule?

No one knows anymore than you do. Do your own research and trust in your own judgement.

Bitcoin emerged as a technology out of necessity. After the 2008 Financial Crisis an intelligent generation became aware that the money we based our economy on was headed for the same fate as every currency from every economy in history: a complete devaluation. Bitcoin is the solution to that.

That is why we are here, thats what this is all about. ATH's, 20% corrections, halving cycles, they're all rounding errors in the end anyways right? DCA, HODL, secure your coins, and go live your life. Quit price watching and quit predicting.

Bitcoin Marketplace(s)?,"So many people view Bitcoin as a store of value and not much more (which is fine, to each their own, and maybe this is actually true). Others view it as the long-term solution to currency. I think one of the big obstacles to the second point of view, being a currency, is the issue of the world's general acceptance of the technology as a viable means to exchange goods. I'm somewhere in the middle, I guess. It's obviously a great store of value in either case, but I also see its potential in replacing (or at least running parallel to) fiat.

In order to gain the world's acceptance, or at least a larger portion of the world, steps must be taken to demonstrate its ability as a currency... it won't just happen. With the onset of layer 2 and any potential future layer 3 plans, the first step has certainly been taken. Transactions on layer 1 are likely to be reserved for huge purchases (I'm thinking cars and real estate or stuff like that). Layer 2 exists for smaller scale purchases (like everyday goods), but how often is it used? And where? Are there online marketplaces built for layer 2 buying, like a bitcoin version of eBay or Craigslist? I'm a software/web developer by profession, and I wonder if it would be worth it to try to create such a simple platform for this to help us take the 2nd step in all this. I don't know the legalities with allowing users to sell online, but I'd imagine the red tape would be slightly thinner since Bitcoin is unregulated (unlike fiat). A user could simply send the sats via layer 2 (or optionally layer 1 if it's a big purchase), and then the seller just sends the thing. It seems as legit as Craigslist and eBay anyway... built on trust that the seller sends the goods. I'm expecting a lot of platforms like this to pop up, and I think they'd be beneficial to the general outreach of bitcoin users, and probably would get non-hodlers to learn more about the technology, potentially convincing them to buy some sats themselves.

What do other people think about this in general? A more useful online presence seems like a logical way to spread the good word.

What's Autofiatgy? 🤔,"Today marks a very special day for me — and, by the time you reach the bottom of this amazing post, for you too.

Today, I introduce a brand new concept and term: ""autofiatgy."" Yes, you've never encountered this term before, and now you're probably wondering where's this bro going with this. Let me explain: ""autofiatgy,"" pronounced ""auto-fiat-gy,"" is akin to autophagy but applies to your wallet. It represents the concept—or dare I say, ""movement""—of shedding that flabby fiat in favour of bulking up with Bitcoin whilst simultaneously physically fasting. Mindblown? Read on...

As Bitcoiners, we're somewhat familiar with the fundamentals of self-sovereignty and the extensive benefits it brings: financial independence, a future-oriented outlook, and positive life choices. Yadda yadda. But what about creating a self-incentive mechanism that rewards low time preference choices by stacking Bitcoin? It's energy money, manifested in one's physical form—the ultimate decentralisation. Hash rate without the hash browns. Lolz. I want to use the term ""somatic,"" but I suspect many of you might find that a bit esoteric and checkout at this point...

Anyway, that's what I'm going to start doing...from Monday (ofc). Starting Monday, each day I complete a 24-hour fast, I will DCA (Dollar Cost Average) with $21 of BTC. This way, I'll burn off my worthless fiat along with my body fat, beefing up not just my Bitcoin stack but also my physique. See the connection? But why stop there? Why not practise DCA (Donut Cost Averaging) and replace the SAT-urated fat from the donuts I didn't eat with sats?

Here's where I should insert a call to action and envision myself as some kind of crypto Spartacus. I need to utter something compelling and rallying, reminding everyone that we have the power to dismantle not only the entire fiat currency system but also the processed food complex, making the world a better place one non-mouthful at a time. But let's face it: you love junk food, you're ingrained with too many bad habits, and yes, you've got a mortgage to pay.

In case you're wondering, a ""dirty protest"" is the act of buying shitcoins with your Bitcoin. But that's a story for another time…

Bye :)

Common nocoiner fallacies: Bitcoin isn't money because,"**Because it isn't backed by anything.**

Answer: No fiat currency is backed by anything. Precious metal backing of currencies ended many years ago.

**Because the dollar is backed by a powerful military and Bitcoin isn't**

Answer: Backing referred to the convertability to gold and silver. A military isn't backing a currency and many of the 100+ fiat currencies don't have a powerful military behind them.

**Because it is volatile**

Answer: Both the Turkish Lira and the Argentine Peso are very unstable and volatile and they are still considered to be money. Both Turkey and Argentina are G20 nations.

**Because it doesn't have an intrinsic value**

Answer: No fiat currency has an intrinsic value.

**Because it's just zeros and ones in a database**

Answer: Most of fiat money is just an entry in a database.

**Because it is created out of nothing**

Answer: Fiat currencies are created out of nothing.

Why I’m Choosing to Build My Service on Bitcoin: The Future of Decentralization,"My first job after college was in the sourcing and trading department of a garment manufacturing and trading company. My responsibilities included placing orders with fabric manufacturers primarily in China, Taiwan, and Southeast Asia, overseeing their shipping schedules, and finalizing payments after each shipment.

Whenever I had to make a payment to our partner manufacturers, I was required to open a Letter of Credit (L/C) at a local bank. L/Cs are commonly used in international trade, especially for large contracts, as they provide a trust mechanism between parties who typically do not know each other. By involving banks as intermediaries, trust is established through a third party.

For instance, as a producer, once you open an L/C at a bank, it acts as your counterparty, guaranteeing payment for your shipment regardless of what happens to the cargo or buyer. This payment is usually settled within 60 to 90 days. Your bank then coordinates with your buyer's local bank to collect the funds. Even in adverse events like a buyer defaulting, the bank can still recover some amount due to the L/C insurance.

However, L/Cs, despite facilitating international trade, are incredibly slow, often taking 90 days or longer to process payments. The bureaucracy involved in requesting an L/C is also cumbersome, involving extensive paperwork, strict banking hours, and the additional challenge of dealing with uncooperative bank staff.

Given today's global connectivity, where face-to-face meetings can easily be arranged in person or via Zoom, the necessity of L/Cs in every international trade transaction seems outdated. It raises the question of whether personal visits to partner factories or starting with smaller, test orders might be more effective ways to establish trust without the need for bank intermediaries.

My conviction is that trust in trade should be built directly between parties, rather than outsourced to third parties like banks or governments, whose reliability has increasingly come into question, especially after the covid pandemic.

This belief prompted my shift to the crypto industry. I saw #Bitcoin  as a revolutionary technology that could redefine trust when people recognize the value of self-reliance. In an era of diminished governmental and financial authority, individuals should have the freedom to invest, send money, and conduct transactions across borders with minimal regulatory constraints.

This is why I founded my business four years ago—to empower individuals worldwide to increase their wealth through technology and cryptocurrency, unbounded by geography or governing bodies. #Bitcoin  offers a vision of a world where anyone can engage in financial activities with anyone else, a cause worth dedicating myself to.",Bitcoin,https://reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1bkoagc/why_im_choosing_to_build_my_service_on_bitcoin/,2024-03-21 22:09:20,0.03945578231292517,0.3360544217687075,0.005,0.134,0.9946

would like to know why you call the blockchain stupid.

Here is why I think it isn't stupid: Everything is hackable, this is a fact. The blockchain is designed in a way that it is only hackable by surpassing 51% of the computational power that is currently being used to secure the network.

It is the most unhackable thing in existence, since you need raw computer power in order to corrupt it. It is very much the case that your local bank is actually way less secure than bitcoin at this moment.

The issue with volatility wont matter if you view bitcoin as a long term investment. Everyone who bought bitcoin and held on to it for 4 years has been in the green. Doesnt matter what time they bought.

The usefulness lies in the fact that its the most secure savings vehicle in existence and that it is able to transfer billions of funds across the planet in a matter of minutes.

"Serious Issue with Coinbase, Missing Transfer After Account Review","Hi guys, I’m facing a serious issue with Coinbase and could really use your advice.  

On March 9, I transferred USDC from BlockFi to Coinbase. Immediately following the transfer, my Coinbase account was conveniently put ""under review."" Despite BlockFi confirming the transaction as successful, the funds were inaccessible due to the review status on Coinbase.

 I contacted Coinbase support, underwent a thorough verification process, and was assured that the pending transaction would be credited once the review was lifted. The account review was eventually lifted, but my funds were still missing. 

 Repeated attempts to resolve this issue have led me down a frustrating path of unfulfilled promises and lack of updates. Each time I've contacted Coinbase, I've been told that my case was escalated to the email support team, with assurances that I would be updated shortly. 

 Each time I reach out, hoping for some actual progress, I'm met with the ""we'll get back to you"" line. And if that’s not frustrating enough, conversations end abruptly, like they’re racing to catch the last bus out of town, leaving me hanging mid-sentence.

Here I am, stuck with my funds in limbo and feeling like I'm just chasing shadows. This whole ordeal has been a marathon of frustration, and the silence from Coinbase is like salt in the wound.

Has anyone else encountered this missing funds situation and been ghosted this hard by coinbase  support ?

 TL;DR: Transferred USDC from BlockFi to Coinbase on March 9, and my Coinbase account was immediately placed under review, blocking access to the transferred funds. Despite BlockFi confirming success and Coinbase lifting the review after verification, my funds are still missing. Multiple contacts with Coinbase support have only led to promises of escalation with no follow-up or resolution.

Look at us now.,"A specter is haunting the modern world, the specter of crypto anarchy.

Computer technology is on the verge of providing the ability for individuals and groups to communicate and interact with each other in a totally anonymous manner. Two persons may exchange messages, conduct business, and negotiate electronic contracts without ever knowing the True Name, or legal identity, of the other. Interactions over networks will be untraceable, via extensive re-routing of encrypted packets and tamper-proof boxes which implement cryptographic protocols with nearly perfect assurance against any tampering. Reputations will be of central importance, far more important in dealings than even the credit ratings of today. These developments will alter completely the nature of government regulation, the ability to tax and control economic interactions, the ability to keep information secret, and will even alter the nature of trust and reputation.

The technology for this revolution--and it surely will be both a social and economic revolution--has existed in theory for the past decade. The methods are based upon public-key encryption, zero-knowledge interactive proof systems, and various software protocols for interaction, authentication, and verification. The focus has until now been on academic conferences in Europe and the U.S., conferences monitored closely by the National Security Agency. But only recently have computer networks and personal computers attained sufficient speed to make the ideas practically realizable. And the next ten years will bring enough additional speed to make the ideas economically feasible and essentially unstoppable. High-speed networks, ISDN, tamper-proof boxes, smart cards, satellites, Ku-band transmitters, multi-MIPS personal computers, and encryption chips now under development will be some of the enabling technologies.

The State will of course try to slow or halt the spread of this technology, citing national security concerns, use of the technology by drug dealers and tax evaders, and fears of societal disintegration. Many of these concerns will be valid; crypto anarchy will allow national secrets to be trade freely and will allow illicit and stolen materials to be traded. An anonymous computerized market will even make possible abhorrent markets for assassinations and extortion. Various criminal and foreign elements will be active users of CryptoNet. But this will not halt the spread of crypto anarchy.

Just as the technology of printing altered and reduced the power of medieval guilds and the social power structure, so too will cryptologic methods fundamentally alter the nature of corporations and of government interference in economic transactions. Combined with emerging information markets, crypto anarchy will create a liquid market for any and all material which can be put into words and pictures. And just as a seemingly minor invention like barbed wire made possible the fencing-off of vast ranches and farms, thus altering forever the concepts of land and property rights in the frontier West, so too will the seemingly minor discovery out of an arcane branch of mathematics come to be the wire clippers which dismantle the barbed wire around intellectual property.

Arise, you have nothing to lose but your barbed wire fences!

-Timothy C. May.

Bitcoin assumptions may be off?,"I'm into Bitcoin for the long-term and I'm ""heavily"" invested. However, there are a few common assumptions regarding Bitcoin that I'm not too sure about.

Many people plan their investing around the 4 year cycle and the halving. I understand the reasons why but there are several basic concepts in investing that generally hold true. One is that nothing is especially predictable other than a long upward trend in general (even that isn't guaranteed).

Once a pattern is deemed to be profitable then arbitrage generally  collapses that pattern. The 4 year cycle of Bitcoin is based on 3 data points. That's not statistically significant.

The halving reward is minor enough at this point that it's not really all that significant given the current daily volume. It may be a small factor but at this point I don't think it's especially significant.

I think that it's more likely that with a larger market cap that Bitcoin will begin to act like any other asset in that it won't be especially predictable and that while it will go up and down over time, it won't be confined by a 4 year cycle.

There is one view, with some logic behind it, that the cycle will be shorter this time since the gains are coming earlier, before the halving and that it has been priced in and that the gains will be higher this time due to the spot ETFs but that the down cycle will begin in early 2025.

As I said, there is some ""logic"" there but it still assumes the 4 year cycle. Maybe that is the way it will play out but I think eventually there won't be 4 year cycles and that there will just be indeterminate up and down years just as with any other asset. I may be wrong as well, of course.

My approach though is going to be to assume that it will behave more like most other assets. I'm not going to focus on ""crypto spring, summer, fall, winter"" and I'm not going to focus on the ""halving"".

I'll not sell most of my Bitcoin, especially for ""timing"" reasons and if I do sell some (never all) it will be for specific purposes. I'm older so it's not about buying a house (I already have one) but it may be to have a larger cash reserve (yes, even debased fiat is necessary currently) or to invest more in stocks if stocks are low and Bitcoin is becoming too large a percentage of my assets.  Even though stocks aren't likely to have returns as great as Bitcoin, to me, it's still a prudent thing to do (some diversification).

Otherwise, my ""advice"" to anyone is to buy and don't sell (with the above exceptions). If I was young, I would be going all in with Bitcoin until I had substantial assets in Bitcoin. I'd put half in a Roth account and half in a taxable account. I'd do this before I started thinking about buying a house.

The longer you can put off buying a house, starting a family, the more likely you are to end up with a standard of living that is above ""average"". It's easy to be average. There is nothing exceptional about being young, getting married, having kids, paying for childcare, mortgages, minivan payments and complaining that the ""American Dream"" is expensive. That's not the path toward ""success"". Be different.

Work hard for at least 10 years and put everything into Bitcoin. Do that and you'll have more choices in life, you won't have to complain about the government, Boomers, things not being ""fair"" or ""affordable"". You won't have to worry about the ""rich"" or the ""greedy"" corporations.

Don't do that and you will be average (shudder):)

IRS declaration - questions regarding tax on crypto gains in Portugal,"Hello everyone,

I think this post might be interesting to some of you as I believe many still consider Portugal crypto friendly.

I've had a look at the IRS tax forms for 2023 where they added the field for crypto gains. I also consulted with a couple of accountans. Now I have serious doubts about how favourable the local tax regime is towards crypto gains.  
  
Everyone says that profit from crypto sales goes to annex G or G1 depending on whether you held your crypto for 365 days before selling. However, both forms request you to write the Portuguese NIF (tax identification number) of Entitade Gestora which is your broker or a centralised exchange. As far as I know, there is not a single centralised crypto exchange registered in Portugal. Many of us use Binance, Bybit, Kraken, or whatever else to get our crypto gains. All these exchanges are foreign and don't have a Portuguese NIF.

See the screenshots below to see the fields in G form and the definition of entidade gestora.

[Annex G](https://preview.redd.it/4xym8lff2rpc1.png?width=1578&format=png&auto=webp&s=f8eaa3e22f98358ae4c1134aa66ee1d302b08f50)

[ In the \\""Management Entity\\"" column, enter the TIN \(tax identification number\) and country of the natural or legal person, organisation and entities without legal personality that provide custody and administration services for cryptoassets on behalf of third parties or manage one or more cryptoasset trading platforms. ](https://preview.redd.it/s7yebdjg2rpc1.png?width=1298&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e4d67a5a42fd9440734f6ee8bf881da194f5449)

The same goes for annex G1 which supposedly should help us declare our non-taxable crypto gains - it still requires a Portuguese NIF for the exchange.

[Annex G1](https://preview.redd.it/gxlhjpvi2rpc1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=45a5d11657fb99f0867d8f241d1bb128ea03223a)

One of the consultants I talked to pointed out that unless you are working with a Portuguese broker or exchange you have to declare your crypto gains in the J annex and pay 28% on them. I was confused because nobody ever mentioned the J annex anywhere in the Portuguese crypto tax guides. Turns out there is a field for crypto there.

It does look more appropriate as it doesn't mention an Entidade Gestora or a Portuguese NIF, you just need to fill in the source country.

[Annex J](https://preview.redd.it/ozi2yg3l2rpc1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=a54065506fba2c78f9f7a33ac8d5aceae02cd05e)

However, the table title reads that you need to put there crypto gains from the sale of cryptocurrencies held for periods below 365 days. So, what about crypto held for 365 days or more?

According to the consultant, they would go in the table 9.1 B for foreign profits with mandatory aggregation, which means the general tax regime with tax brackets of up to 48% depending on your income level.

[Table 9.1 B](https://preview.redd.it/qq1oamyp2rpc1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf99e322e21149789aaac856462527c665f93248)

I don't understand why because I don't see how gains from cryptocurrencies fit into any definition of the profits indicated in this table. But could he be right?

[Table 9.1 B - Definitions](https://preview.redd.it/fc735cur2rpc1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=181b7fc193fdcbd37232290f80b54d34ee6493c8)

I don't see how this could be right but then I also didn't know that crypto gains made abroad can or must be reported in Annex J.

So, my questions:

1. Do you think this is right?
2. If not, then how should we report crypto gains made from the sale of cryptocurrencies on foreign exchanges, such as Binance, and held for a period of 365 days or more? Binance doesn't have a Portuguese NIF that could be put in the G or G1 annex.
3. If the first point is correct, then why the hell nobody mentions this? How can the Portuguese tax regime be considered crypto friendly if you need a local broker to sell crypto? Why did nobody mention this in 2023 when they only introduced crypto taxes? Who even uses local brokers to sell cryptocurrencies? Everyone is on centralised exchanges. (Sorry, I needed to vent)
4. Did any of you rich Bitcoin holders consult with anyone reliable regarding crypto taxes in Portugal and did you find out anything that could help?

Fiat Money Is An Invasive Species?,"NOTE: This is a ChatGPT output. Posting here to see if the general concept resonates with people before I dig further into the idea. Paired with an explanation of the Cantillon Effect, this could be a great way to communicate the problem with fiat to no-coiners. :shrug: 

""Fiat money, like an invasive species, disrupts established systems by detaching from intrinsic value, akin to how invasive organisms unbalance ecosystems by lacking natural predators. Traditionally, money was a direct claim on physical assets (e.g., gold, silver), embedding a natural check on its abundance and value, much like native species evolved with checks and balances within their ecosystems. Fiat money, introduced as a human invention without direct backing, proliferates without these natural constraints, disrupting the monetary ecosystem.

This proliferation mirrors the unchecked spread of invasive species that exploit resources without contributing positively to the local environment. Just as invasive species outcompete natives for resources, leading to diminished biodiversity, fiat money can dominate an economy, leading to issues like inflation and wealth disparity, which undermine economic diversity and health. Moreover, the ""introduced"" nature of fiat money—decoupled from tangible assets—parallels how non-native species are introduced into new environments, often with unforeseen and sometimes detrimental impacts.

Both fiat money and invasive species illustrate the consequences of altering natural systems without fully understanding the long-term effects. In ecosystems, this can result in the loss of native species and altered landscapes; in economies, it can lead to financial volatility and loss of trust in currency. Thus, fiat money can be seen as an invasive creation within the natural order of monetary technologies tied to human societies, highlighting the importance of understanding and cautiously managing human interventions in complex systems.""",Bitcoin,https://reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1bkcedh/fiat_money_is_an_invasive_species/,2024-03-21 13:39:21,0.09152892561983474,0.34285714285714286,0.052,0.132,0.9762

Understanding market cap and why it’s a fugazi. ,"
For those who might be new to Bitcoin, it’s important to understand what market cap actually is…

Market capitalization (or market cap) is something you’ll hear a lot about when it comes to BTC and other coins. It’s a number that’s calculated by multiplying the last traded price x the outstanding supply. So if a coin has a supply of 1 million and the price is currently $10, the current market cap  is $10 million. It’s constantly fluctuating in line with price. 

This $10 million figure doesn’t mean every coin is worth $10, nor does it mean that $10 million has been invested. It doesn’t represent actual money - it’s a fugazi.

 I’d argue the $ symbol shouldn’t be used to denote market cap at all. 

 I could launch a coin with a supply of 1 million today, sell 1 coin to a friend for $10, and suddenly I own 99.99% or a crypto that has a market cap of $10 million. Only $10 was invested, and if I tried to sell all my coins for $10 each, the price would instantly collapse to 0. 

One of the main reasons FTX collapsed so quickly,  and SBF’s “net worth” was lost overnight is because it was all tied to the market cap and price of the FTX token. SBF was never a billionaire in real terms, no more than I’d be a multi millionaire in the above example. 

The only way market cap is useful is so 1 cryptocurrency  can be benchmarked against another. Most have different outstanding supplies so this provides an easy way to compare and rank.

Market cap is a function of price, not the other way around, and there is no “cap” on  how high something can go.
 

Next time you read an article saying BTC or other coins can’t reach x value because the market cap would be too high, or worth more than all the money in the world etc, remind yourself that market cap doesn’t represent money or value, it’s just a number.

Fed's Decision Yesterday to Tolerate Higher Inflation: Great for Bitcoin," The recent Federal Reserve announcement, described by Mohamed El-Erian in [this interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeY9l7q-kx8) marks a pretty pivotal moment. The Fed displayed a surprisingly dovish stance, indicating a willingness to accept higher inflation rates for an extended period. This approach, coupled with comments on slowing the reduction of the balance sheet, suggests a shift from strict inflation targeting to a broader, more flexible strategy that allows higher inflation. I don't think they have a choice if they want to get out of the trillion dollar debt problem alive. They are going to devalue the US dollar.

The dovish signals from the Fed are not isolated. Other central banks, including the Bank of Japan and the Swiss National Bank, have also shown a propensity towards maintaining loose monetary policies.

"No, it's not great irony to measure Bitcoin's value in fiat","I've seen a couple popular posts/comments implying it is ironic or contradictory to measure Bitcoin's value in fiat. I wanted to broadcast some thoughts in response:

The fiat price of Bitcoin is merely a proxy to quantify Bitcoin's value. Fiat, for all its flaws, is currently the universal language of money, it's a convenient, granular, familiar and easy to understand unit of account - the measuring stick for economic value. Imagine trying to gauge Bitcoin’s value in, say, barrels of oil or ounces of gold. Sure, it sounds cool and apocalyptic, but it’s not exactly convenient for day-to-day comprehension.

Now, for the real mind-bender: measuring Bitcoin's value in a depreciating fiat might actually highlight Bitcoin’s strength. If Bitcoin's price in fiat skyrockets faster than fiat’s own inflation or depreciation, isn't that a neon sign flashing Bitcoin’s increasing value? It implies the same stack of Bitcoin can now be exchanged for greater goods and services. What's not to celebrate about that?

In a world where fiat is the ruler, Bitcoin is the revolution measuring its conquests in the current language of the people. So, the next time you see someone celebrating Bitcoin's rising value in fiat, remember, it's not a contradiction. It's a testament to its unstoppable rise.",Bitcoin,https://reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1bk3jr1/no_its_not_great_irony_to_measure_bitcoins_value/,2024-03-21 06:40:00,0.1851851851851852,0.46929012345679005,0.064,0.182,0.9766

Move from Trezor One to Jade ?,"Hello hodlers :)

I stacked some sats for more than a year on my Trezor One, then I bought a Blockstream Jade.

Now I want to secure the sats. The smallest KYC UTXO is around 5 mil sats, so I don't think I really need to consolidate them. The Jade is untouched yet.

So now I have 2 options (IMO): 

\- create a new wallet on Jade and consolidate/move the UTXOs from Trezor One

\- load the existing wallet on Jade so I can have 2 hardware wallets in 2 different places (geographically)

I only use Trezor (lets say monthly) to receive sats that I bought on the exchanges and that's it, so I don't think the risk of being robbed is high. I'm more concerned about losing the seed phrase or broke the hardware wallet.

Should Bitcoin have more decimals onchain in the future?  So the blocksubsidy can keep halving sub-satoshi level? ,"

Should we get consensus to add more decimals on chain (sub-satoshi level) so we can keep continuing halving the blocksubsidy onchain? 

Otherwise miners will only get tx-fee's as reward for mining . 

If the price is after the last halving high enough,  maybe we could continue halving the blocksubsidy for much longer time without creating relatively more inflation. Just more sub Satoshi decimals.

consider that maybe it could be that we could add more data with relatively low fee in the blockspace in the future.   when we maybe have more segwit type stuff, schnorr signatures, other taproot like stuff, zk-rolllups, sidechains..  More stuff That makes blockspace cheaper 🤔

I think a lot about these things. But in more than 100 years we probably need new quantum proof eleptic Curve Cryptography that makes blockspace maybe more expensive 😬🙈

Creating a cold wallet using an old phone that won't connect to the internet anymore,"Is it possible and safe to create a cold wallet using an old phone?
Steps would be:
1. Factory reset an old android device
2. Download the electrum app

4. Create a new wallet
5. Use the wallet as cold storage

Another question:
Can I create a view only address with this way on electrum so I can check balance and receive funds using another phone?

Is it too optimistic to hope that Bitcoin is moving toward a wider distribution as time goes on?,"My simple logic is this: If someone owns 1 or less than 1 Bitcoin, they're most likely to hodl as long as they can as that's the most beneficial strategy.

If someone owns 1,000-10,000 that only makes them more likely to sell if they want the capital for whatever reason.

BLOCKCHAIN.COM IS A SCAM!!,"I would give them zero stars if that were an option!! I purchased bitcoin over a month ago. The transaction failed, but it was taken from my bank account. After a month of writing countless emails. I finally received my canned response today. I am so disgusted I could literally throw up, they said that it was on my bank and that the funds were returned which they were not. They claim the transaction in question was on February 24 which I can assure & Prove it was on a completely different day. So I demanded proof of this bitcoin transaction that was returned to my bank account. Because that’s an absolute lie!! And to make it all even better they blocked my account so there’s nothing I can do!! (So they think!) but it’s only just begun because I am going to make this my life‘s purpose to let everyone know how this horrible company is run by thieves and disgusting scammers. DO NOT USE blockchain.com EVER EVER!!!!! Unless you want to just lose your money with nothing in return because they will steal from you and then block your account. I promise justice will be served on them. It may take a while and it will probably cost me a lot of money, but I am the one that will damn sure make a point of it. For I’m having this overwhelming feeling like this is my life’s purpose!!

Bitcoin is treated like a risk asset,"The perception of Bitcoin as a risk asset rather than a hedge stems from its historical behavior in correlation with traditional markets, particularly equities. Bitcoin’s price movements have often mirrored those of risk assets like stocks, leading many to view it as a speculative investment rather than a safe haven.

However, proponents argue that Bitcoin’s scarcity and decentralized nature make it a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty, akin to gold. They suggest that its limited supply and lack of correlation with traditional assets could provide diversification benefits in a portfolio.

The recent reaction to the Federal Reserve’s indication of potential rate cuts illustrates Bitcoin’s current alignment with risk assets. When the Fed hints at accommodative monetary policy, both equities and Bitcoin tend to rally, suggesting a correlation between the two.

Yet, it’s crucial to recognize that this correlation doesn’t guarantee Bitcoin’s performance in all market conditions. In the event of a significant downturn or “black swan” event in traditional markets, Bitcoin could indeed experience a sell-off as investors seek liquidity and safety in more established assets.

Ultimately, while some investors may view Bitcoin as a hedge, its behavior in various market environments underscores the importance of thorough risk management and understanding its role within a diversified investment strategy.",Bitcoin,https://reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1bjnszi/bitcoin_is_treated_like_a_risk_asset/,2024-03-20 16:41:35,0.11130952380952379,0.5491402116402117,0.093,0.14,0.8442

How I successfully Orange-Pill,"I have had great success in orange-pilling my relatives and best friends, even though they were haters or skeptics. It’s always because of the same thing.

Do not try to sell it to them. 

First master it, you know you have done it when you are able to explain everything in simple terms, like if you were teaching a kid. 

Then, and ONLY THEN, tell them about it. Your confidence will make them trust you on the topic and showing you are not just another guy trying to fool them, you just want to share a passion. 

Then, encourage them to LEARN about Bitcoin, not to BUY Bitcoin. And ONLY ONCE THEY STUDY IT, and COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND IT, allow them to invest. Consistently tell them that if you do not understand it, do not put money into it.

Give them the resources that you think are good teachings. Make it easy for them to learn about it. I normally recommend the obvious things like the Bitcoin Standard, and Micheal Saylor Interviews and podcasts.

Self Custody vs not having access to your own keys… again your decision. If you want a multi sig or hot wallet that too is YOUR decision. There are countless options and there are more growing everyday on how to use and store your hard earned SATS. That is a demonstration of value itself.

Don’t try to convince your friends and family to buy bitcoin.,"I know, you are maybe hearing this a lot nowadays, but I still want to emphasize this.

You can mention it once, but that should be it.
Otherwise you can only lose:

- if they haven’t done any research on their own already, they’ll almost always think you are an idiot. If they have, there’s no need to convince them anyway.

If you actually manage to convince someone you also lose: 
- price drops 20%, they’ll sell and will be angry at you
- price goes up, they’ll ask you why you haven’t told them earlier. Then price dips again, they’ll be angry, think you convinced them of some BS after all, and sell again.

Everybody needs to go this road on their own. It takes a lot of research and is a learning experience, to become a HODLer. Most people can’t handle the volatility.

So it's taken me some time to really get into and understand bitcoin. The lightbulb moment for me was actually reading the whitepaper. The reason I bring that up is because that is what convinced me to move my stuff off exchange (as a newbie).

I tried downloading sparrow wallet to start. I am absolutely sure I went to [sparrowwallet.com](https://sparrowwallet.com)

HOWEVER, every time I download and start to use it my windows freaks out and is like ""yooo sparrow got some trojan shit goin on bud, it's severe. You gotta take action and quarentine that shit bro.""

I deleted the apparent trojans and sparrow but now I'm spooked and I already didn't really know what kind of wallet to start with.

THE FUTURE OF BITCOIN MINING...,"* Large scale miners are beginning to show dominance in the industry and continuing to add capacity rapidly
* Smaller miners are starting to consolidate to achieve economies of scale
* Network hash is higher than where most expected and continuing to grow aggressively
* Hashrate will become more globally distributed at scale.  Already seeing sovereign adoption kicking off (UAE/Burma).  Significant growth expected from Latam, Middle East, South East Asia, Africa.  
* The race to zero energy cost mining has begun: a) Bitcoin miners are currently helping to stabilise grids and cost engineering their net energy cost down as a result; b) Bitcoin miners finding other creative ways to net off energy costs (e.g. monetising waste heat).  This trend will only continue.
* Bitcoin mining will compete, head-on, with battery technology (when it finally catches up) as the 2 main tools available to energy grids for stabilisation.
* The logical candidates for Bitcoin mining in the long run are energy companies with excess energy they are unable to store or transport it (i.e. zero marginal cost of energy)
* Bitcoin mining returns will drop to where this becomes a yield investment on capex.

#Bitcoin is a shining beacon of TRUTH in 🤡🌎.,"I'm fed up with living in a world where deception and dishonesty seem to prevail. Everywhere I turn, I'm bombarded with lies and half-truths. Politicians spin false narratives, corporations hide behind PR facades, and the media peddles sensationalized clickbait. It's exhausting trying to separate fact from fiction.

But amidst this chaos, there's one beacon of hope that shines brightly: #Bitcoin . It's the only truth I see in this clown world. Bitcoin's decentralized nature and transparent blockchain technology offer a refreshing respite from the constant manipulation and corruption. It's a system that operates on trustless consensus, without the need for intermediaries or middlemen. For once, I feel like I have control over my own money and my own destiny.

I know some might call me a ""maximalist"" or a ""fanatic"" for my unwavering belief in Bitcoin. But I'm willing to ""die on this hill"" because I know that Bitcoin represents something much bigger than just a digital currency. It symbolizes freedom, sovereignty, and the possibility of a better future.

With Bitcoin, I can store value without relying on inflation-prone fiat currencies or manipulated financial markets. I can transfer wealth without being beholden to predatory banks or payment processors. And I can participate in a global economy without being subject to arbitrary borders or restrictions.

Of course, Bitcoin isn't perfect. Its price can be volatile while its going through early store of value phase, its adoption can be slow, and its community can be contentious. But its underlying principles – decentralization, transparency, and security – remain unwavering.

In a world where lies and deceit seem to dominate, Bitcoin is a shining beacon of truth. And I'll continue to hold on to that truth, no matter what.

Everyone has forgotten why bitcoin matters.,"Bitcoin was created in response to the 2008 financial crisis as a way to opt out of a failing banking and fiat system, but people seem to forget about this fact all too easily.

Everywhere on social media all I see is people talking about when to buy and when to sell in order to make more fiat. The true bitcoin OGs out there never thought this way, they wanted bitcoin as a way to protect their wealth from a failing financial system.

In 2008 the thing that caused the financial crisis was interest rates being raised from 1% to 5%. It is the raising of interest rates that always causes something to break and this time around we have raised rates from 0% to 5.5%.

Something is going to break because of this, it is an inevitability. There will be a black swan financial event that will sweep around the world, we just dont know what the trigger will be or when it will start.

When this happens banks around the world will fail, bail-ins will begin where a percentage of your bank account balance will be taken from you in order to try and save your failing bank, and central banks will flood more money into the system than ever before causing inflation to skyrocket. The only asset that will protect you from inflation, protect you from bail-ins, and allow you to transact outside of a failing banking system is bitcoin.

The entire world is going to run to bitcoin at the same time when this happens including governments who will confiscate any and all bitcoin held with a custodian as part of a bail-in policy to ""protect"" the fiat system and the banks.

Interest rates have been raised, the fiat system is cracking at the seams, its just a matter of time before a black swan event causes a financial crisis worse than 2008 to sweep around the world, and the one safe place everyone on earth will run to will be bitcoin.

This is why bitcoin exists.

If you run a node, you query your own node with all the addresses there, no one knows which specific addresses you are looking at.
2. You can decide which rules you want to follow and have a vote on Bitcoin’s future: Big organisations want to increase block size? Change Bitcoin code to add something you are against?

But **fear not!** Here's why **you should stay calm and HODL** *(btw HODL stands for ""Hold On for Dear Life,"" emphasizing the strategy of holding onto your cryptocurrency investments regardless of short-term price fluctuations)* :

* **Volatility is Normal**: Just like any market, Bitcoin experiences ups and downs. **Don't panic** when prices dip – it's a natural part of the journey.

I understand the silence.,"There are a lot of people who lurk in this sub and I’m starting to understand why.

It’s great for quick spurts of information but the community can go from helpful to toxic pretty quickly.

When things were up last week everyone was overjoyed and optomistic posts were welcome with open arms, and everyone was rooting each other on.

But you have one downturned week, like this one, and everyone is bashing each other and calling optimistic posts ‘corny’ and ‘ridiculous’ and shoving people away, and God forbid you try to give the newcomers any kind of hope.

I’m the only person involved in BTC, amongst my family and friends, which can feel quite isolated, and I thought this would be a place to hang out with likeminded people, but perhaps the search continues. 

If you’re triggered just reading this post, perhaps reflect on that.

Everything is going to be fine. Remember the market fluctuations are not in your control and history has shown us that things go up over time.

Pricing bitcoin in USD? (Fiat),"I've noticed that in this subreddit, a lot of people keep an eye on the price you can get for selling bitcoin (including myself quite often).

What I find interesting is, at least for me, that the amount of bitcoin I own primarily matters in the amount of bitcoin I have, and pricing it in an inflationary asset is misguided to say the least.

The cognitive dissonance I feel I have is the belief and knowledge  that the amount of btc I own isn't going to depend on fiat, at least in the long run. However i do find myself consistently looking at the price of bitcoin rather than the Sats I own. I have a strong belief that in 25+ years, I will be considerably wealthy in terms of bitcoin, but for some reason here and in my own life I can't get away from checking how much my btc is worth from a fiat standard...

That being said, I know we are long ways away from diverting from a fiat standard, and therefor going to still price things in fiat for the considerable future, I just think people would benefit from (including myself) focusing on the sats they have rather than the amount they can get from selling. 

I guess that's why they say 1 btc = 1 btc

The top doesn’t matter.,"Just a reminder for all the newbies who bought at the top recently and are now starting to pull their hair out.

We’ve all been there.

Close the app and go touch some grass. 

Or… buy some more of you can. That’s what I just did, because I never cry over a discount. 

I always assume the current ‘top’ is the future ‘bottom’ and I’ll never see lower prices again. That way, it’s always a pleasant surprise, and an opportunity to stack, when it does.

The unsound investment of Bitcoin,"Just curious as to hear what everyone else’s thoughts are regarding Bitcoin currently

My current understanding of the pros and cons of whether to invest in it are as follows: 

Pros: 
- supply shortage 
- positive sentiment surrounding the halving 
- El Salvador 
- continuous printing of fiat currencies means that BTC can theoretically go to infinity 

Cons: 
- volatile
- fundamentally has no real use 
- unsustainable blockchain validation process

Overall, my opinion is that I will only ever invest if it becomes clear the us economy has avoided a recession. This is as BTC is expected to be correlated highly with high beta risky assets and thus a recession would be detrimental to its growth. Do we think the current price has this risk priced in?

Coinbase vs Kraken vs Robinhood Spread & Fees,"From time to time I'll see some threads where people ask where is the best exchange to purchase BTC and the fees associated. These purchases are made through the ""quick buy"" (for recurring purchases) and not through the exchange itself.. ***we already know that buying directly from trading/market will be cheaper so you don't have to make that comment here.***

All of these orders are for $200 on the ""review"" page:

**Kraken:** $200 for 0.00309709BTC at $63,304.30 and a fee of $3.94. (Bank ACH)

**Coinbase:** $200 for 0.00315868BTC at $63,317.59 and a fee of $2.99. (Bank ACH)

**Robinhood:** $200 for 0.00318041 at $62,884.83 and a fee of $0.70 (Bank ACH)

&#x200B;

I'm curious on everyone else's experience and if there are any other exchanges that provide lower spread and fees?

I've used Coinbase recurring orders in the past but moved over to Robinhood due to the lower spread and fees.

Does a passphrase add entropy to a 24-word seed to make it more difficult to random brute force attack?,"Does adding a 6-word passphrase to a 24-word seed make a wallet significantly more difficult to brute force attack?  The 24-word seed already has 256 bits of entropy (the maximum available) so the passphrase won't add additional entropy, right?  

If this is the case, the passphrase is only really effective for physical security (i.e. someone finds your seed phrase but can't access your wallet unless they then find/brute force your passphrase.)

Stock Market & BTC portfolio??,"In the stock market, a bad idea. I love btc and consider myself a btc maxi

i only have a .25 coin which is ok (still stacking) since starting my btc journey in dec2020

but i am interested in the stock market and want to get into it. i see it as a good way to appreciate wealth but ofc im conflicted. nothing will appreciate like BTC so i know id be missing out on gains purposely comparative to BTC (long term)

but i also see it as a layer of wealth i can tap into before tapping into BTC fund which i see as a plus

i have pretty decent salary but i don't have much savings (<500) bc i throw it all in btc rather than watching it die in my bank acc. but i am well aware i should have emergency savings for just in case, i am working on this but rather slowly like 100 each pay check to savings. but then i get into a loop seeing $1000+ in savings doing nothing but depreciate. especially in the months of NOV-JAN with the halving coming closer and closer

i have determined i will have a savings but probably only $1000 but with inflation is that even enough, this def a case by case basis but idk how much would y'all recommend?

also thoughts on having a layer before btc wealth like stock market even tho it underperforms btc?

How could a World with mass adoption look like?,"I've been trying to think about how a world could look like, once Bitcoin is globally accepted and a ""nornal"" paying method. 

This is not me challenging if it's possible or not, but rather really being curious how it would work out.

Would offline markets like local stores, coffee shops, etc. all have a live connection to the exchanges, in order to not sell their goods under value? Would they maybe just update their prices once per day? Would the price be shown in Bitcoin next to USD/EUR etc. next to every product, or would other currencies even still exist?
What if Bitcoin is still crazily volatile in the future? How would the small companies & entrepreneurs survive big drops in price then? Or even on employee side - imagine being only paid in Bitcoin, but then getting paid out at a time of a low-price Phase and earning less than what you are used too.

But maybe mass adoption would lead to the volatility reducing towards 0 as the market dictates the ""final"" price.
I guess as I am writing this I think my question is not ""what will the price be?"" - I couldn't care less about the exact number - my question is rather: ""is it possible for bitcoin to reach a 'final' price?"" Where it increases/decreases only about 0-2% or so.

IIRC one theory could also be that the currencies get backed by Bitcoin similar to as it has been with the gold standard, but how this would exactly look like is a bit hard to imagine for me (maybe there will be these exchanges/stores where you can sell your gold stuff or buy gold at the current rate, but just with bitcoin lol).  
I also think just looking at how the system worked with the gold standard and transfering this to a bitcoin standard doesn't work 1to1, as we almost live in a different world now compared to 19xx.

Really curious on your thoughts, if you had similar thoughts or maybe came to some conclusions because I didn't consider a particular thing etc. :) Also, if you guys/ladies have any resources that are diving into these topics, feel free to share - would be happy to expand my knowledge, as I love to invest my time into learning more about bitcoin etc. when I'm out of money to Invest :P

Grayscale now uncompetitive and the price dip is just a restructuring of the ETF market,"Looking at the flows from the ETF's it seems to me that Grayscale has really taken a tanking since the opening of the other spot ETF's. The price decrease seems to have resulted in large scale flows from Grayscale but all the other information suggests large inflows of cash still flowing into the BlackRock and fidelity ETF's. 

&#x200B;

The price volatility is definilty more than I would have expected with the large amount of coins taken by the ETF's and placed in cold wallets. However I wonder if most of the sales from the grayscale ETF are making their way to the other spot ETF's. As they are mandated to but the underlying asset in order to match the inflows of the funds I can not see a scenario where this does not result in a price increase following the halving. ou would think this downside volatility will reduce over time with the increased commercial holdings

"Grayscale still hold $25.32 Billion worth of Bitcoin. At an average outflow day, it will take them exactly 3 months until their Bitcoin holdings are depleted.","Since I figured the price of Bitcoin would be a lot higher were it not for Grayscale dumping massive amounts of Bitcoin into the market every day (although these price corrections we're seeing are a healthy sign for Bitcoin), I thought I'd do this very basic math. Please bear in mind these are just figures for the ETFs:

GBTC currently holds **378.17K BTC** worth **$25.32B**

* Assuming a steady **outflow** rate, at an average of **$270.5M** per day since January 11th ($25.32B/$270.5M), it will take them ***3 months*** (approx. 93.6 days) until their holdings are depleted;
* Assuming a steady **inflow** rate, at an average of **$261M** per day ($25.32B/$261M), it would take ETFs **97.01 days** to absorb what Grayscale is dumping.

With the Halving approximately 1 month away, supply shortage can become an issue very quickly.

What're your thoughts on this ?

A Global Tax on Electricity for Bitcoin Mining Would Not Affect Profitability,"# Effects of a theoretical global mining tax

Every miner would have their electricity costs increased by 30%. Network hash rate drops by 30%. Mining difficulty drops by 30%. Bitcoin transaction time balances out and 900 bitcoins are still produced per day (450 after the next halving). The same amount of revenue is distributed amongst the mining network at 30% less hash rate. At the end of the day everyone is getting paid the same amount to do 30% less ""work"".

# Public good

From a public good perspective this would decrease the global demand for electricity by bitcoin mining by 30%. Demand for electricity increases the price of electricity as well as increases environmental impact. 30% less electricity demanded by the network means 30% less carbon emissions and lower electricity costs for consumers. An optimized network would run at the lowest possible hash rate to ensure security. The network becomes less efficient as hash rate increases.

There's also a consideration that the tax money would decrease governmental defecits. Lower deficit means less inflation, and everyone on here understands how bad inflation is.

# Network Security

Theoretically, higher hash = better security, but there are diminishing returns. As the hash rate grows, a 51% attack becomes economically unrealistic and we are well past that point currently. Additional hash rate therefore doesn't decrease the practical chances of a 51% attack because it's already not a risk. Likewise, there is leeway for the hash rate to drop without impacting network security. Hash rate is a function of bitcoin price, mining costs, and the current block rewards + transaction fees. As such, each halving impacts the hash rate in a similar way that a global tax would.

TL;DR:

A theoretical global tax on electricity for bitcoin miners would have minimal impact on the bitcoin network, no impact on mining revenue, would decrease carbon emissions, decrease consumer cost of electricity, and could help decrease governmental budget deficits.",Bitcoin,https://reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1bitqe0/a_global_tax_on_electricity_for_bitcoin_mining/,2024-03-19 16:02:24,-0.013333333333333324,0.28,0.094,0.104,0.3804

And even the tech progresses in that way (exchanges/meme coins/ so many dex's) because the people in this space continue to focus on new ways of making more money in the space.

Bitcoin Fraudster Giovanni Santostasi Is Triggered And Threatens To Dox Me LOL!,"I was amused today when I received an invite to chat from Giovanni Santostasi threatening to dox me because I made a post asking why he is begging people for $1 in tips on Patreon when he is selling people trading indicators that he states predicts the price movement of bitcoin.

Why doesn't he just use his own trading indicators that he is selling to earn money?

This man is dangerous because he tries to convince people that his PhD in Physics means he can predict the price movement of Bitcoin.

The only thing he did was plot the log-log of the price of bitcoin relative to time. Anyone that is decent in math can do this.

Genuine discussion: What are your arguments against these common criticisms of Bitcoin?,"Hey everyone, in the midst of this bull run we're seeing a lot of meme posts, tweets, and people recklessly shilling Bitcoin. I would like to take the opportunity to ask this community some more genuine questions about their view on some of the common criticisms against Bitcoin.

* Bitcoin consumes a huge amount of energy

As Bitcoin continues to be more adopted, so does the amount of energy it consumes. Bitcoin transactions are complex and it is said that 1 Bitcoin transaction consumes more electricity than a US household does in a month. The Bitcoin network consumes more electricity than some countries, and if it was to be globally adopted it could consume more electricity than is currently produced in the world. Since this emits a lot of carbon, some people argue Bitcoin is environmentally damaging.

* Bitcoin runs on the greater fool theory and therefore is a ponzi scheme

Anytime money is invested into Bitcoin, it goes into the pockets of the previous holders. If you buy Bitcoin, you'll always make a profit (relative to buying power), but only on the condition that there is someone next in line ready to buy after you at a higher price. And since the amount of people willing to buy Bitcoin is limited, in order to make  
a gain you are relying on greater fools to buy at a higher price and take a loss when you exchange your Bitcoins for something else. This is why Bitcoin is often criticised as a ponzi scheme, the early investors win and those late to the party will get burned.

* Bitcoin has no value

Many people argue that Bitcoin is extremely valuable for 3 main reasons:

1. It has a limited supply and therefore the price will appreciate.
1. Bitcoin is decentralised and so there is no entity able to corrupt it.
1. Lower international transaction fees

However, many people argue that these advantages only serve as speculation which gets Bitcoin more adopted and allows more people to fall for the ""scam"". It could be criticised that it is a macro version of speculative altcoins. Many Bitcoin maximalists call altcoins a scam as their value is speculative and the price only drives up when people who believe the speculation buy in, some would argue that Bitcoin is doing the same.

So, I am curious what the Bitcoin community thinks about these criticisms and what counter arguments you can make for them. Please note that the purpose of this thread is to serve as an informative discussion rather than cause controversy.",Bitcoin,https://reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1birczi/genuine_discussion_what_are_your_arguments/,2024-03-19 14:27:15,0.18455357142857146,0.4946428571428571,0.119,0.12,0.1298

Break it and get 159k sats,"Hello,
My 12 words were generated by an air-gapped Bluewallet. Then I encrypted them with a passcode, and then created a QRCode that I engraved on a steel plate (using my own laser engraver).
It is extremely elegant and resistant.
Neat.

I keep this metal plate in a safe place. It is just in case of my death or absence. I know my words by heart and every time I need to sell (which I don’t because I hold), I create a wallet on an air-gapped Bluewallet to sign the transaction. On my mobile, I have a wallet with the xpub just to receive and transmit the signed transaction. 

I’d like to test how good the encryption and the approach is if the metal wallet ends up in adversarial hands.

So I am proposing a challenge. I created a new wallet and topped up with around $100 (159k SATs).
This is the xpub for you to view and verify:

"Hal Finney told his story with Bitcoin, 11 years ago today.","""I thought I'd write about the last four years, an eventful time for Bitcoin and me.  


For those who don't know me, I'm Hal Finney. I got my start in crypto working on an early version of PGP, working closely with Phil Zimmermann. When Phil decided to start PGP Corporation, I was one of the first hires. I would work on PGP until my retirement. At the same time, I got involved with the Cypherpunks. I ran the first cryptographically based anonymous remailer, among other activities.  


Fast forward to late 2008 and the announcement of Bitcoin. I've noticed that cryptographic graybeards (I was in my mid 50's) tend to get cynical. I was more idealistic; I have always loved crypto, the mystery and the paradox of it.  


When Satoshi announced Bitcoin on the cryptography mailing list, he got a skeptical reception at best. Cryptographers have seen too many grand schemes by clueless noobs. They tend to have a knee jerk reaction.  


I was more positive. I had long been interested in cryptographic payment schemes. Plus I was lucky enough to meet and extensively correspond with both Wei Dai and Nick Szabo, generally acknowledged to have created ideas that would be realized with Bitcoin. I had made an attempt to create my own proof of work based currency, called RPOW. So I found Bitcoin fascinating.  


When Satoshi announced the first release of the software, I grabbed it right away. I think I was the first person besides Satoshi to run bitcoin. I mined block 70-something, and I was the recipient of the first bitcoin transaction, when Satoshi sent ten coins to me as a test. I carried on an email conversation with Satoshi over the next few days, mostly me reporting bugs and him fixing them.  


Today, Satoshi's true identity has become a mystery. But at the time, I thought I was dealing with a young man of Japanese ancestry who was very smart and sincere. I've had the good fortune to know many brilliant people over the course of my life, so I recognize the signs.  


After a few days, bitcoin was running pretty stably, so I left it running. Those were the days when difficulty was 1, and you could find blocks with a CPU, not even a GPU. I mined several blocks over the next days. But I turned it off because it made my computer run hot, and the fan noise bothered me. In retrospect, I wish I had kept it up longer, but on the other hand I was extraordinarily lucky to be there at the beginning. It's one of those glass half full half empty things.  


The next I heard of Bitcoin was late 2010, when I was surprised to find that it was not only still going, bitcoins actually had monetary value. I dusted off my old wallet, and was relieved to discover that my bitcoins were still there. As the price climbed up to real money, I transferred the coins into an offline wallet, where hopefully they'll be worth something to my heirs.  


Speaking of heirs, I got a surprise in 2009, when I was suddenly diagnosed with a fatal disease. I was in the best shape of my life at the start of that year, I'd lost a lot of weight and taken up distance running. I'd run several half marathons, and I was starting to train for a full marathon. I worked my way up to 20+ mile runs, and I thought I was all set. That's when everything went wrong.  


My body began to fail. I slurred my speech, lost strength in my hands, and my legs were slow to recover. In August, 2009, I was given the diagnosis of ALS, also called Lou Gehrig's disease, after the famous baseball player who got it.  


ALS is a disease that kills moter neurons, which carry signals from the brain to the muscles. It causes first weakness, then gradually increasing paralysis. It is usually fatal in 2 to 5 years. My symptoms were mild at first and I continued to work, but fatigue and voice problems forced me to retire in early 2011. Since then the disease has continued its inexorable progression.  


Today, I am essentially paralyzed. I am fed through a tube, and my breathing is assisted through another tube. I operate the computer using a commercial eyetracker system. It also has a speech synthesizer, so this is my voice now. I spend all day in my power wheelchair. I worked up an interface using an arduino so that I can adjust my wheelchair's position using my eyes.  


It has been an adjustment, but my life is not too bad. I can still read, listen to music, and watch TV and movies. I recently discovered that I can even write code. It's very slow, probably 50 times slower than I was before. But I still love programming and it gives me goals. Currently I'm working on something Mike Hearn suggested, using the security features of modern processors, designed to support ""Trusted Computing"", to harden Bitcoin wallets. It's almost ready to release. I just have to do the documentation.  


And of course the price gyrations of bitcoins are entertaining to me. I have skin in the game. But I came by my bitcoins through luck, with little credit to me. I lived through the crash of 2011. So I've seen it before. Easy come, easy go.  


That's my story. I'm pretty lucky overall. Even with the ALS, my life is very satisfying. But my life expectancy is limited. Those discussions about inheriting your bitcoins are of more than academic interest. My bitcoins are stored in our safe deposit box, and my son and daughter are tech savvy. I think they're safe enough. I'm comfortable with my legacy.""

"Even simpler rebuttal to people claiming that no one would spend a deflationary currency: If you know everything would be 2% cheaper next year, what would you actually stop buying?","TLDR: The argument essentially boils down to: If you can currently buy Bitcoin, which is expected to increase in value, why spend your money on anything else? Obviously, people don't only buy Bitcoin, so the argument that Bitcoin cannot act as a currency because it is deflationary is flawed.

The people making these claims are assuming that Bitcoin is deflationary by nature (which makes sense) so let's assume so. They also argue that it is because we are currently working with an inflationary currency that the economy is working as it is today, with people deciding to spend their money the way they do.

If Bitcoin is a deflationary currency, and we assume that, relative to Bitcoin, everything will be on average 2% cheaper every following year, then why would anyone be spending any money now instead of exchanging their fiat for Bitcoin, which reduces to the case where people are using Bitcoin as a deflationary currency? Since people aren't deciding to spend little to none of their money, simply because they can instead buy Bitcoin which is expected to increase in value, this reduction tells us that people's purchasing behaviours would not be drastically different from what they are now, if we began to use Bitcoin.

The only major difference, as pointed out by this post:

Decentralized Government ,"
1. **Infrastructure Development**: Developing robust technical infrastructure supporting the Bitcoin blockchain and Layer-2 solutions for voting and proposals is crucial. This may involve adapting existing solutions or developing specific DApps.

2. **Ensuring Participation**: Ensuring broad citizen participation is essential for a democratic government. Mechanisms need to be developed to ensure all citizens have access to voting and proposal platforms and can actively participate.

3. **Ensuring Transparency and Security**: Security and transparency are fundamental for a democratic government. Technologies used, such as the Bitcoin blockchain, must be robust and implement strict security measures to prevent tampering.

4. **Developing Governance Models**: Governance models need to be developed to ensure decisions are made in a fair and democratic manner. This could include incorporating various voting methods, thresholds for decisions, and mechanisms for resolving disputes.

5. **Legal and Social Acceptance**: Establishing legal frameworks and gaining broad social acceptance for a democratic decentralized government based on Bitcoin and blockchain technology may require political and public support.

6. **Education and Awareness**: Since many citizens may be new to using Bitcoin and blockchain technology, education and awareness initiatives are important to promote understanding and acceptance.

7. **Continuous Improvement and Adaptation**: Implementing a democratic decentralized government is an ongoing process requiring continuous improvements and adaptations to respond to changes in technology and society.

Reminder for new members: bitcoin is for saving. ,"Hi newbie!

When lambo? No. Nope.

Bitcoin is already the best savings tech you have ever used and by using it and learning about it as you use it your world view will probably shift for the better. Long time preference and seeing hard work in savings grow not shrink. 

How do you use bitcoin ""correctly""?

Save in it. Put away money into bitcoin* each money with the understanding you can't touch it for at least 4 years. In year 5 you can spend what you saved in year 1 if you need it. If you spend some (converting back to local fiat, paying tax, buying stuff you need) then that's ok. That's the point of the savings technology. You save it and when you need it; it's there to use. The bonus part is the longer you delay spending the more you can buy. 

TLDR: bitcoin is not a lambo millionaire tech, but it does even better. It allows you to save money from a real world job and have a chance at a house deposit or retirement one day.

*how you do the into bitcoin part is up to you, cold storage, ETF, exchange account, etc it's all personal preferences and there is plenty of information on those topics in the sub.

Sat Status?,"Just something fun to think about.

I’ve recently seen people refer to someone who holds 1M sats as a ‘satillionaire’, and now I’m wondering how that term would scale.

Since this wouldn’t easily lend itself to adjusting the first few letters, perhaps adding a prefix?

If we used traditional Greek Numerical Prefixes, it might look something like this:

1M = Satillionaire AKA ‘A Monosat’

5M = Pantasatillionaire AKA ‘A Pentasat’

10M = Decasatillionairs AKA ‘A Decasat’

100M = Centasatillionaire AKA ‘A Centasat’

1000M = Kilosatillionaire AKA ‘A Kilosat’

Is there a more fitting set of numerical prefixes?

0.1 bitcoin,"at time of writing will run you 9k cad buckaroos or 6.5k usd (god our dollars fucking shit eh)


9k for 10,000,000 satoshi is, while expensive, still an incredible bargain, to stake your claim and get a piece of this 21m monetary network. 

If you are reading this right now and are able to *comfortably* stack 0.1 BTC (without bankruptcy) in your portfolio and you haven't yet, I highly suggest you a) do more research on Bitcoin and b) buy enough bitcoin to reach at least 0.1 BTC while we're going thru this mini dip. Otherwise you will come to regret it. 

One of these days we are going to see BTC break 135k cad (100k usd), at which point newcomers will be aiming for under 10m satoshis, and the new benchmark will move from 1.0 BTC to 0.1 BTC.

9k in savings alone is already out of reach for a lot of families and working class professionals where I live, but possible with stable income and savings etc. Obv be responsible dont yolo your emergency fund and have other investments, diversify etc

Most people in my life own exactly 0 BTC and think its a scam/too expensive etc.

"How does average quality of life for low, medium, and high earners change in money printing countries (namely the US) after the transition to a bitcoin standard?","In developed countries, it seems that quality of life is subsidized by money printing I'm wondering if quality of life would overall be reduced if put under a bitcoin standard? Bitcoin would help create a global standard of what work is worth. 

Currently in the US, for example, a low skill worker might make $10 per hour. The same job might be done in a low wage country for $1 per hour. Does Bitcoin adoption change the gap between these two peoples' wages? Do they both go up? Do they converge somewhere in the middle? Does it stay the same?

Under a Bitcoin standard it seems the most important things for a country will be:

* How early did your country adopt bitcoin? - How much bitcoin per person does your government have in reserves? How much bitcoin per person do your citizens own?
* How much general technology/infrastructure (manufacturing, roads, building infrastructure, etc) head start do you have?
* How smart are your people to generate new innovations?

why is there no undo function?,"

maybe i'm missing something, but i do not understand why there can't be a way to reverse unspent transactions.   

it seems to be a huge design flaw/oversight to me that everyday  people are expected to never make mistakes when sending cryptos and to  keep their private keys perfectly safe and never forget their passwords  (if applicable). even exchanges that can afford to spend millions on  security & safety sometimes make mistakes, so how can average joe be  expected to do it better?   

imo, blockchains aren't safe. they rely on users being perfect, which is simply not the case.   

another problem is safe storage of paper wallets. how do you know  with certainty that nobody made a copy or took a picture, or keylogged  your password? the answer is: you can only hope. there are never  guarantees. blockchains do not solve this problem. look up how many btc  got lost and compare that to money that vanished in banks. does btc  really do better?

Sparrow Wallet,"I am currently working on transferring my Sats from my ELLIPAL titan to a newly purchased cold card.

Questions on the Bitcoin protocol,"hey all , even though i have been involved in the crypto space for past 4 years now. never took the time to truly understand it.  doing whats long overdue now.

Some questions,

1. from my understanding all the upgrades in the main bitcoin chain right now are softforks and softforks are changes such that new rules / features are implemented but the old rules still apply. so even if a miner does not update their node they would still agree with the transactions sent by the nodes running the new version ... if so would it be safe to say if i took a node running the bitcoin 0.1 version ( the version in which the genesis block was mined ) and ran it through all the transactions today. it would still clear all of them and mark them all as valid? chatgpt says this is false, is it wrong. if it is correct then how would the new upgrades be considered a softfork then?
2. as the block rewards get thinner and thinner. and eventually coming to a point where the nodes are only mining for the transaction fee. from a economical perspective do you think the miners would still continue? yes of course if the price keeps increasing they would but what if there was a prolonged bitcoin winter. and prices for some reason plummeted .. this makes it no longer practical for the miners to support the network. and if there are no miners to support the network would it not collapse the network?

Proof of Work algorithm: the end line of bitcoin's value is eventually the price of energy required to mine it.," Hi all,

I would like to hear the opinion of someone technically knowledgeable on the subject, because this is not my field.

I would like if someone could point out if I am making any mistake in my reasoning.

My understanding is:

1. The proof of work algorithm behind bitcoin's blockchain is designed in such a way that a block must always be released at a given frequency. Therefore, the difficulty of the decryption problem tunes itself depending on how much hashrate (and so electrical power) is being invested in mining at any given moment.
2. If bitcoin price increases due to market dynamics (demand/offer), miners are incentivized to mine depending on the differential between the cost of energy necessary to mine, and the current value of bitcoin.
3. When miners do so, the global hashrate increases up until the total price of the energy spent is equal to the current value of bitcoin.

For these reasons, wishing for a bitcoin to reach very high values is essentially equivalent to:

A) Reaching a point where massive amounts of energy will be necessary (so that the price equilibrium between energy and bitcoin value is matched).

B) Reaching a point where the unit price of electrical power is very high, even if the necessary quantity is low.

Neither of the above scenarios seem good to me, and this is the reason why I don't believe the way bitcoin is designed can sustainably keep it at such high value.

Case A) essentially means we will be wasting a lot of energy just to keep the value of bitcoin high

Case B) means we have other problems to worry about, such as energy becoming more and more scarce.

My work won't allow BTC ETF as an investment option in our 401k. How can I change that?,"I work for a large global company who just happens to be owned by none other than Berkshire Hathaway.   We have fidelity as our 401k partner and they have the FBTC ETF option available currently.

I called Fidelity to confirm that their fbtc ETF is available to be put within the account and they confirmed it was. The reason it wasn't available to select as an option is because the company specifically declined to do so.

I contacted the investment advisor at my company and asked them why this wasn't an option. All I got in response was a one sentence reply:

""This option was discussed at a committee meeting and deemed too risky due to regulatory uncertainty""

I responded back with an email full of bullet points talking about how this was deemed to commodity by the SEC, how a Bitcoin ETF was recently approved in January, how fasb is allowing corporations to carry Bitcoin on their balance sheets and also stating the fact that fidelity already offers this as an investment option.

I even offered to me with this committee to discuss their concerns about this asset being unregulated. Still waiting for a reply back on that email but in the meantime I'd like to know if there are some talking points or a script of sorts I could use to convey the point.

I can't help but think the sole reason why this is not allowed is due to the fact that Warren and Charlie think it's rat poison squared. The fact that their personal bias impact the financial well-being of myself and every single person employed within the company I work for really pisses me off.

If anyone has been down this road before or knows of some resources I could use to convince the powers that be at my company to change their stance I would greatly appreciate it.

Value of Bitcoin held on exchanges in $USD," 

[data from cryptoquant](https://preview.redd.it/vm0tat6683pc1.png?width=1396&format=png&auto=webp&s=d56484c9b5c155d3183af98643cc6a8d9a4d3037)

Observations:

1. $USD value of bitcoin held on exchanges has increased approximately +114% over the past year.
2. Since ETFs were approved $USD value on exchanges increased +48%
3. Quantity held on exchanges decreased by 11% over the past year
4. Quantity held on exchanges decreased by \~4% since ETFs were approved (-81K bitcoin)

ETFs have acquired a net of 216K bitcoin so far. That 216K has only decreased quantity on exchanges by 81K. Possibly retail is taking profits, possibly people transfering bitcoin holdings to ETFs, possibly ETFs getting filled some other way.

$USD value of bitcoin held on exchanges peaked at $180 B during the peak in November 2021. This trend of increasing $USD value held on exchanges goes against the supply crunch narrative (for now). At current prices the halving will decrease new supply by $31 M per day, or .023 % of exchange held supply per day. 

Basically, the price is increasing faster than the quantity held on exchanges is decreasing, which has caused the $USD value of Bitcoin held on exchanges to rise.",Bitcoin,https://reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1bhpqzh/value_of_bitcoin_held_on_exchanges_in_usd/,2024-03-18 08:40:16,-0.09928977272727274,0.6455965909090909,0.0,0.135,0.9723

"The simple rebuttal to people saying no-one would spend a deflationary currency: If you knew everything would be 2% cheaper next year, what would you actually stop buying?","People often attack Bitcoin by saying no-one would ever spend it. Well, as it stands now, yes, you'd be stupid to spend your bitcoin. The potential for growth is just too high.

However, it is just a fact that bitcoin cannot continue this growth indefinitely. At some point it will stabilise. It will still be deflationary, but the 50% rises in a year will be a thing of a past. You'll just see small, incremental deflation on a year to year basis (as opposed to fiat which slowly bleeds you out). At that point you can ask: What would you actually stop buying if it will be 2% cheaper next year?

Sure, a currency that deflates 50% a year on average wouldn't be spent. But then, a currency that inflates on average 50% a year is useless too. If you're going to talk about deflationary currency not working, then use deflation figures in line with what you would use for discussing in inflationary currency.

"Buying bitcoin with cash(USD) is similar to buying cash(USD) with another less valuble currency, like pesos. Change my mind.","For instance, if you buy btc with American dollars, that is very similar to buying American dollars with Mexican pesos. I'm not saying it's exactly the same. But it is in fact *very* similar, and with the exception of a few specific details, you could say it pretty much is the exact same thing. Both are currencies and both currencies have fluctuating values. Sooo....?


Right now, about 17 pesos equals one American dollar. So hypothetically, let's say I spend 17 pesos so I can have one American dollar instead, and, let's say that my goal and reason for this transaction is to eventually get more pesos than what I started out with. Then after a month, let's say the American dollar becomes worth 22 pesos, so I decide to ""sell"" my dollar for pesos so I can end up with 5 extra pesos.

Will it really keep going up? ,"What do you think about this? 
One side: BTC will become more scarce, fiat currency becomes debased, supply increases exponentially so the price of btc = supply of fiat$/supply of btc -> results in increase of btc price as fiat supply increases.

All good and well, but what about this? 
- Mining companies have gone down 90% so no real impact from it being more expensive to mine 
- current BTC circulating has no real use except trading, and most of btc has already been mined so the future halvings will not change much 
- Decentralization does not work, too expensive and inefficient
- No business takes crypto because of its volatility (will it ever even settle at a stable price?)

Bitcoin is perfect money because perfect money is pure information.,"First money was different commodities, then money was gold, then money was gold represented by paper, then money was paper represented by bank ledgers.

This is a phyiscal way to view money but money has only ever been information. The items we used as money were just a way to communicate information about value to eachother. 

When humans exchanged a gold coin that was the mechanism used to communicate to the rest of the world that value had been transferred from one person to another and that one person now held more and one person now held less. The gold was the informational mechanism telling everyone else who had what amount of value in society.

In a prehistoric tribe of cavemen who keep tally of one person owing another person some food by etching it into a cave wall, that ledger on the cave wall was their form of monetary information because it was their method of transacting and communicating value.

Money is pure information we just havent had the ability to represent money as pure information before bitcoin, instead we have had to use inefficient abstractions to represent monetary information. Bitcoin represents the first time humanity has had the ability to represent money as pure information making information the monetary asset itself.

Every other form of money we have ever used in history has been inefficient and inferior. Bitcoin is money in its most pure form.

The true state of money is to be pure information, the monetary asset itself is pure information and bitcoin is the first technology that has allowed money as information to be globally uniform, decentralised and recognised by all nations on earth equally.",Bitcoin,https://reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1bhgg66/bitcoin_is_perfect_money_because_perfect_money_is/,2024-03-17 22:51:05,0.1718915343915344,0.44120370370370376,0.027,0.089,0.9575

Bitcoin is better than Gold in almost every way possible.,"Bitcoin has absolute scarcity with 21 million hard cap, while Gold's stock to flow inflation is about 1.5-2% a year on average. 
After April halving this year, Bitcoin's stock to flow inflation will officially dip below that of Gold, and will become *hardest asset ever* by definition. 

Bitcoin is faster than Gold and extremely portable, you can send a billion dollars from New York to Tokyo and have it final settlement in 30minutes. 

Bitcoin is easily verifiable on the blockchain if the fund is there or not. Gold often has to be melted down or cut to verify theres no tungsten inside then the seller's charged a re-smelting fee etc. 

Bitcoin can be divided down to a hundred millionth of a bitcoin and transmitted at such infinitesimal amounts (network fees can, however, make transmission of tiny amounts uneconomic, this is where L2 and eventually L3 comes in). Gold is very difficult to do so without incurring additional cost.

Both Bitcoin *and* Gold are **fungible** and **durable**, with Gold having the longest established history as a monetary good.

However Gold is a poor store of value whose price has been largely the same over past decade against rampant inflation while Bitcoin has seen explosive, albeit extremely volatile, growth and adoption in same amount of time.

Bitcoin, despite its short existence, has weathered enough trials in the 15-year market that there is a high likelihood it will not vanish as a valued asset any time soon. Furthermore, the Lindy effect suggests that the longer Bitcoin remains in existence the greater society’s confidence that it will continue to exist long into the future. 

Aside from being a dumb shiny yellow rock, used in jewellery, art and electronics, Gold is inferior to Bitcoin in nearly every way. 

Gold is stuck in the ground, Bitcoin is stuck in time. It's time we embrace the future.

Isn't the halving at least partially priced in?,"Whenever my kids ask ""why does that thing cost that much"" we just work out way down the supply and demand narrative. If more people want it, it's worth more. If there are less available, it's worth more. Makes sense.

How do you predict Bitcoin's price?

Similar story, supply and demand. Lots of complex factors modify the demand: availability of fiat currencies, ease of on-ramping, simple and secure ways to hold, social reputation not only of BTC but also the exchanges, and, most significantly by far, clarity of information about the two fundamental features of bitcoin (immutable ownership and immutable supply limit). For my kids, simply, how many people want it, and how many are there.

I feel that this basic formula is applied to BTC's halvings too simplistically. Yes, the supply via mining will halve. But, that is not the full picture supply. The real supply us only minimally changed by halvings, it's those Bitcoin owners who want to buy things.

The ""true believers"" probably won't sell BTC for fiat, unless they're quickly buying something with it (surgery for a family member, a property, education costs, groceries, stocks). But there probably still is an ""overpriced"" value many would have some sense of. If someone was offering to buy BTC at $1m USD tomorrow, many of use would sell some BTC to benefit from that jump. Many would sell entire portfolios expecting it to dump by 90% sometime also.

My question is, if we know what % of supply mining counts for, and what % of people will never sell under any circumstances in the next decade, we can work out what % of an impact on the true supply thr halving will have.

"Is there a financial advisor ""flippening"" in the works?","I am fascinated by the financial advisory industry and Bitcoin.  The industry has been trained to sh\*t on Bitcoin for years and years (speculative, gambling, no intrinsic value, not backed by anything etc. etc.). but there appears to be a “flippening” which much more Bitcoin chatter in the mainstream financial media.

This is why Fidelity and BlackRock ETF was a game changer.  (Versus who the f\*\*k is Coinbase, FTX and Binance??)

I am beginning to believe advisors will shift from “it is irresponsible for me to put you in bitcoin” to  “it is irresponsible for me NOT to have you in bitcoin”

When will clients start asking “Why didn’t you have me in the best performing asset of the decade?” if they are not already?

Does the script change to “For our conservative investors we are going to put you in at one percent as a hedge. For aggressive investors we will put you in at 5% for our most aggressive investors we are recommending a 15% allocation.” Our research team shows this is likely to improve returns due to his lack of correlation with traditional stocks and bonds, superior Sharpe ratio yada yada yada.

If this occurs in reality it will be more rocket fuel for bitcoin!

I am sure there are many FAs on this sub - how are you folks thinking about bitcoin?  If a >0% allocation for everyone on the table?  Am I wrong here and just sniffing bullish hopium?  Sincerely curious....

"It's that period in the bitcoin cycle when those who pursued econ and philosophy are cool, for a while.","TL;DR: This post isn't about money.

For those seeking original opinions, here's mine for anyone interested. I've been around for a bit,  I understand the username is new. I've been reminded. I'm nobody special. 

This is a long, poorly written, rambling post, and a product of boredom and you should move on and enjoy your Sunday.

All you need to know: College, first time on a LAN, Napster, 17 years old. I pursued degrees in psyc, phil, and econ, despite constant reminders of their ""worthlessness"" unless I ventured into finance or chose a STEM field. Instead, I worked in seedy bars, indulged in Bukowski, traveled on tips, went to punk shows and embraced ""hipster"" culture. 

When the 2008 financial crisis hit, I logically moved into IT project and program management, and marketing (refer to ""Office Space,"" 1999, for a summary of the following 15 years).

As macroeconomic theory becomes trendy again, I too am hoping to exit the trenches of corporate America. Frankly, I'm less concerned with bitcoin's price now and more interested in pursuing things that matter more to me.

Parting advice: Read widely (I've recommended books in previous posts). Don't be afraid to think outside the box, as the Austrian economists did. 

For those curious about understanding bitcoin/blockchain beyond the basics, I suggest Peter McCormack on YouTube. His work resonated with me, seeing others with similar backgrounds engaging thoughtfully with these topics. There was a long drought, I had trouble finding good content, so cheers to that McCormack guy. 

Lyn Alden is another person who I think has extremely valuable insights. This sub seems to be on board with her already. Lasly, use tools! Use AI, use every tool at your disposal to learn. I ran this post through ChatGPT to help with grammar and legibility (I need plenty of help). We're not all technical writers, that's ok, use.all.the.tools.  

And if someone wants to discuss economic principles, or macro theory as it relates to digital assets, real-politics, or what have you, make sure to ask them to easily define the study of economics first. From personal experience, it is amazing how few people can give a basic, competent definition of what the hell the study of econ is. Dont with those people, it's death by 1000 cuts. Same thing goes for books. If someone wants to talk about a book or author that is controversial, for any reason, and they havent read the book, then their option of that book is fuck-all. It does not matter how they feel about the work or the author, and the fact that they want to share an opinion about something they haven't read tells you everything you need to know, and fast. Run from these people. They could not be more irrelevant. Fuck, run from anyone who tries to ban books in general (those people are relevant and very dangerous). 

Fuck Ayn Rand but the passage written about the nature of money in Atlas Shrugged is worth a second look, and I dont care what other flaws are present in her work, I dont need to agree with any or all of it, but it'd be dumb to discount the whole thing because... actually, no ,i dont know why people do stuff like that. It's dumb.

I think a lot of us Oregon Trail kids were forgotten for a while, doing the family raising thing, maybe some of us are back to do important things with folks on both sides of our generational divide, and help make sense of what is happening in the world around us. I think GenX, millennial, and Z have much more in common that many other sets of 3 generations in American history (Stowe & Howe, another recommendation)

If you're losing interest, this might be a good place to stop reading, it doesn't get better.

I'm interested in the concept of collective consciousness manifesting through what we call signs. Individuals can create scenarios that increase the likelihood of certain outcomes. For example, altering your route home to pass by someone you're interested in could lead to a serendipitous meeting and a shared future. This concept, I believe, is applicable to the broader impact of blockchain/bitcoin, which has moved beyond proof of concept. More people are beginning to grasp its potential. 

I do think this is one of the most exciting macro economic advancements of all time, I look on in awe, and it's been tough to find like minded people outside of niche internet places.

I'm now focusing on the impact of true resource ownership on art. I am not talking about NFT or token art, I'm talking about how this economic principle is going to affect real sentiment in the physical world. I love to discuss how Postmodernism has a relationship with our closely held beliefs about ourselves and what is ours, and what is us, and where is that line? Another interesting thing worthy of further exploration: The question remains: what is the oppressive ""elephant in the room"" that diminishes our time, soul, and humanity? While many references exist, like the ""Orange Pill,"" I believe these ideas also warrant further exploration. I'd rather engage in meaningful discussions than endure mundane corporate life. No Christina from account, I do not want your homemade cheesecake, it is 9AM. No more.

Having gained confidence and stability, I'm ready to explore these themes further. I don't need wealth; I aim for a fulfilling life without compromising my soul. As bitcoin grows, I understand its significance beyond financial terms. It opens discussions on human interactions, value, and existence in a world influenced by true ownership of your own mind (crazy right?).

If it matters to you that I've been around for a while, take this as you will, it's the best proof I'm willing to provide, it feels as if it were a lifetime ago, the good kids are the weird ones: [https://www.reddit.com/r/baltimore/comments/1z7fix/dogecoin\_meetup\_in\_baltimore/](https://www.reddit.com/r/baltimore/comments/1z7fix/dogecoin_meetup_in_baltimore/)

My insight on bitcoin's price should be met with critical thinking and skepticism. I dont day-trade. I dont do finance stuff. I do keep up on geopolitics, marco economics, and existentialism. My strategy is based on observation on world econ, the idea that Wall Street's manipulation through ETFs and OTC markets will continue until it can't due to bitcoin's limited supply. Markets, like people, can act irrationally individually but show order in large numbers. Bitcoin, much more protected from corruption by design, promises the hope of a more rational future. I believe its price will significantly increase in the next X months, probably sooner. This is not some kind of secret. The secret is that our system has made everyone so fucking doubful of what is right in front of them that they can no longer confidently distinguish what is real and what is noise.

Couple questions with Coinjoin and Coldcard," Hi  all, I currently am looking to move my stash from my Trezor wallet over  to a Cold Card and as I've been looking into all of this it seems like  using a mixer like Coinjoin when I transfer the funds sounds pretty  appealing to try to at least severe the ties of how much I own.

As  a scrub that was new to bitcoin, I have bought all my sats through KYC,  first CB then got off that pos site and over to Cashapp and Kraken. Now  I primarly use cashapp but privacy is definitely a concern of mine, and  I didn't learn about the nonKYC exchanges until it was too late.

At  this point I'm not going to sell all my sats to rebuy them in a nonKYC  exchange. While that would be the best solution, I'm still a bit  confused on how being taxed with my sats works and don't want to mess  around with selling.

What I'm  thinking is going Trezor to Sparrow wallet then coinjoin to cold card,  but my big question is once I do that I would no longer be able to sell  back on the KYC exchanges, right? I'm guessing I could only sell them on  Bisq?

I've also heard that using a  mixer could and might screw up the legitimacy of my sats since they are  KYC and that it's a bad idea to do this. Is this true or just FUD?

Finally,  how much privacy does this really grant me? I'm really not looking to  avoid paying taxes. In fact I'd be curious how getting taxed on sats  works as I have a number in mind for when the Bitty's hit to sell off  some to pay off my house, but need to know how much I'm going to get  taxed to make sure that's the right number in mind.

Bitcoin is amazing man,"What an incredible invention we have the privilege of owning. 

To be able to save your money in something with a 21m hard cap supply, that can never be debased, cannot be confiscated, cannot be censored, cannot be restricted, cannot be stopped, is 100% liquid and can be transacted at anytime 24/7/365, is nothing short of incredible. 

The price of BTC is the least fascinating thing about it imo. The more you learn about this thing the more you cant believe it actually exists.

Opinion: This is exactly where we will see if institutional shorting will play a role,"I'm not saying it will or won't happen. I'm not trying to say I have a crystal ball.

With an ETF and wall street + ease of access also comes an ease of access (relatively speaking) for these institutions to short bitcoin - if they were to decide to so. 

Fundamentally you may see shorting bitcoin to be a death sentence. Maybe it is. But we are yet to know if big money is going to go that direction. We are yet to see if all the bitcoin accumulated in this run is truly locked up. Or if it is an asset to be traded like anything else to them.

In my opinion, big money does like to play both sides of the market. If they play bitcoin in any similarity to how they play everything else, I wouldn't be surprised if institutional shorting plays a role in Bitcoin drawdowns.
On the flip side, more shorting = larger short squeezes and liquidations.

How this plays out, I have no idea. Just something in my mind as we flirt with ATH after a sizeable run.

My opinion - what happens next will determine the foundation of next year. Whether all this accumulation holds the market firm at a higher price, or if short term traders opt to sell, and the Market finds a lower fair value.
If all this accumulation is truly locked in. Skies the limit.

Bitcoin's Relationship with USD and MXN (& other currencies),"
Lately, I've noticed a decline in the value of the US dollar against the Mexican peso, now hovering between 16.5 and 17.70 MXN, compared to the 20 to 23 MXN range of previous years. While this makes it cheaper to acquire dollars, it has also impacted the value of my Bitcoin investment, which is tied to the dollar. Although BTC has nearly reached $74,000, its value in MXN is now lower due to the strength of the Mexican peso. This situation leads me to question whether Bitcoin will decouple from the dollar in the future. Additionally, the possibility of Middle Eastern countries ceasing to use the dollar to trade oil could further weaken the dollar, affecting non-dollarized countries like Mexico. In this context, the strength of the Mexican peso could diminish the incentive to hold BTC, as even if its value in dollars reaches $100,000, if the dollar falls to 12 MXN, the value in pesos would be the same as before.",Bitcoin,https://reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1bh1izf/bitcoins_relationship_with_usd_and_mxn_other/,2024-03-17 12:19:28,-0.0446969696969697,0.20833333333333331,0.027,0.138,0.9517

An idea for lost coins. Looking for feedback on my regarded level,"So I was thinking, over many decades, many coins will become forever lost due to lost keys. How about every 5,256,000 blocks (100~ years), for any wallet that has not moved coins from it, those coins will be forfeit in the next block to whoever mined it. There could also be a special message that can be broadcasted to the network at any point before forfeiture, signed with the private keys of the wallet, that resets this block counter, just like moving any amount of btc from the wallet would also do.

Why 100 years? I arbitrary chose it, it's longer than most people will live for, and preventing the coins forfeit is easy to do. The 100 years could be increased to another number, say a thousand for all I care.

To be clear, I am not saying new coins be created. I'm only saying that lost coins be added back into circulation.

I think this idea is useful if over time, many coins become lost, and the network is no longer liquid enough and something else tries to take its place. I'm aware Satoshi's can be cut up into smaller and smaller units too. This would also encourage transaction verification, which increases network health, long after the last bitcoin has been mined.

In regards to dip buying,"What’s up to all my bitcoin fam. Shout out to all the risk takers and world changers that sees what is happening. I tip my hat to ya.

I wanted to drop a piece of advice one of my grandmas told me when buying my first home. Around 2021 my wife and I purchased our first home. It was a big deal because my dad and mom didn’t own a home and I felt like I was on my way to bringing on some possible generational wealth. I was VERY stressed during the buying process. Having a wife and three kids, I wanted to make sure I got the best deal. So I spent so much time worrying about prices. One day I was talking to my grandma, sharing with her my stress. She dropped a gem that I still think about when investing. After sharing my worries, she replied, “Sweetie, regardless of the rate or if it’s a little higher than expected just remember, no one in 20 years says ‘Damn I wish I waited to buy that house’”. And man, that stuck with me. And it’s so true. When you look at the way houses have gone up, people usually wish they purchased another home. 
So I use that logic with investing today. Taking advantage of dips is fine and can give us a hand up, but ultimately in 20 years when bitcoin is $10,000,000 per coin or whatever astronomical number it is, the dips ain’t gunna matter. It will be such a small blip of time compared to years of long term investing. So with that said, I want to remind yall to breath, relax, and enjoy this amazing ride. The stress of trying to buy in at the rate time is not needed when you plan to HODL. Zooming out and looking at something from a Birds Eye view is quite different than watching the day to day.

Peter Schiff got to me.,"Been stacking Bitcoin for ages, convinced it was the unbeatable future. Like many here, I laughed off Peter Schiff’s warnings as mere noise—until I actually listened. Schiff, it turns out, isn’t just a naysayer; he’s got a deep grasp of economic dynamics and, yes, even Bitcoin itself.

This sparked a thought: we get Bitcoin, but will the masses ever catch up? The tech is there, sure, but perception is everything. And with a major crash looming, possibly intensified by big players like Blackrock muddying the waters with a Bitcoin fork, public trust could take a hit. Imagine Bitcoin tumbling to 10k and the chaos that follows.

So, I made a move that might surprise some: I shifted half my Bitcoin stash into gold. Was it the right call? Time will tell.

TLDR: Doubts crept in, and I diversified into gold, balancing between two worlds. Let's watch how the future unfolds.

EDIT: Believe me, I am a hardcore Bitcoiner. I want bitcoin to succeed, gold has already failed as a store of value, central authorities have proven that they can just make gold illegal and confiscate peoples gold, thats why wee need something better.

Why is there so many hoops to jump through when spending my own money on Crypto, and they try to say they are doing it to protect me, yet I could drop £20k in a gambling site and they wouldn’t even give a shit.

Rant over.

Are there any banks that you have used within the UK that allow purchasing through Kraken that you have had no bother with?

Seeking a credit card that i can pay balance with bitcoin ,"I would love a credit card (not debit card) that can be used to rack up fiat debt, then will accept a direct bitcoin payment to pay off the fiat debt at the end of every month using current exchange rate. 

 This would eliminate the need for using an exchange off-ramp to sell bitcoin when i want to make purchases at stores using fiat, so spending my bitcoin wouldn't drop the market price of bitcoin, and would allow me to keep more of my wealth stored directly in bitcoin rather than keeping such a large buffer of fiat to pay of my cc. Does this exist?

EDIT:
it seems that this does exist with Bitpay Billpay because i can use crypto to directly pay off a normal credit card:

Discussion about store of value,"Hi everyone, i’ve been hearing a lot about bitcoin, and gold, being a good store of value. And money too but subject to loosing value due to inflation. 

What I have trouble wrapping my head around is the store of value part: let’s say you have USD 100’000 into a Bank account, with 1.5% inflation: in 5 years would have a purchasing power of around 92.7k. Not good (you still have 100k on the account but you can buy less for the same amount).

But if you would have put it in gold or BTC, selling it 5 years later at 100´000, it would be the same issue, no ? You would still be stuck with buying less. 

No Matter what your purchasing power would still be less than before because of inflation.

Or what we mean with store of value, and an asset retaining it’s purchasing power, we mean the ability of the asset to outpace or follow the inflation , right ? 



[edit 1]  Thanks everyone for your inputs. I realize I might have not been clear in my post but some of you understood my train of thought about store of value and purchasing power.

Seeking guidance on where Bitcoin protocol discussions take place,"Hello Bitcoin community!

I've been a part of the Bitcoin ecosystem for some time now, closely following its development and the various discussions surrounding its future. One thing that's been on my mind lately is the process of protocol upgrades and how the community navigates these changes, especially given the challenges of reaching consensus in such a decentralized environment.

I'm aware that major protocol discussions and decisions don't happen on Reddit, and I'm keen to dive deeper into where these critical conversations take place. I understand that Bitcoin's development process is both intricate and nuanced, involving a wide array of contributors from different backgrounds.

Could anyone here guide me on where I should look to find these discussions? Specifically, I'm interested in platforms or channels where developers and contributors discuss potential upgrades, security enhancements, and other protocol-related topics. I've heard of the Bitcoin Dev mailing list and Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) but would love to get more insights into how I can access these resources and possibly contribute to or learn from the discussions.

Additionally, if there are key conferences, workshops, or forums that serve as important venues for these debates, I'd appreciate recommendations on how to stay informed about them.

I believe understanding the intricacies of these discussions can help community members like myself become more informed and supportive of the development process. Thank you in advance for your guidance and insights!

Bitcoin,"I cannot post on bitcoin beginners subreddit for some reason, so here I go:

How is bitcoin any different than vintage car collectors, or beanie babies. It seems like it’s just something arbitrary that is only worth anything because a bunch of people think so. Obviously this is how currency works but how is it “guaranteed to hold value” if it’s only worth something as long as the group wants it to be worth anything. Seems like a big gamble to put so much money into a currency system that isn’t regulated or made ‘official’ I guess. I also hear about what great things it will do for developing countries but it seems like a wealth gap speed run to me, people who already have money can afford to buy more or pay for mining centers then can just hoard it. The only people who will share in the success are those who had enough before to have disposable income. And if a small group of people pay for mining centers, then hoard the finite amount, what is it worth then? If those hoards are dumped back into circulation suddenly surely the value goes down; but the bitcoin ‘never losing value’ is one of the selling points? 

I just can’t really process how it is any different than vintage car collectors. A few companies will have bulk storages of old cars and sell them to people, and people sell to each other because of the perceived value, but at least classic cars have a real world value. You can drive them, they are nice to look at, they are tangible materials. If the perceived value of bitcoin disappears there is no real world value.

Buying a house on a Fiat vs. a Bitcoin Standard,"There's been A LOT of FUD spewed out there on various subs by people who simply can't wrap their brains around how things would change on a Bitcoin standard.  That's fair and understandable since it is very hard to evaluate ""the system"" while operating from within the system.  In other words, its very difficult for most people to see the forest through the trees.  Fortunately, there are a ""few who understand,"" and so...Let’s do a thought exercise here comparing a home sale on the current Fiat standard vs. a hypothetical future Bitcoin standard. We’ll base it on some real math and reasonable assumptions. You can set this up in an excel spreadsheet yourself to check the math.  We'll start with a Bitcoin standard

HYPOTHETICAL BITCOIN STANDARD HOME PURCHASE:

Let’s say that we’re magically transported into some future environment where there is a bitcoin standard and the market actually is a free market and, as Jeff Booth has so eloquently described on MANY occasions, it is deflationary in its natural state because technology and society’s progress are deflationary (e.g. you can store the entire library of congress now on a $500 iphone etc…).

So, in this environment, let's *generously* say that REAL inflation is 0% (it would be more like -3% in reality). In our hypothetical future, whatever entity is “the Federal Reserve” would no longer be the corrupt institution it is today, and thus the federal funds rate would essentially match inflation (again, we’ll generously assume 0% here). Let’s also assume for the sake of argument that commercial banks will still exist (a reasonable assumption) and they set the prime rate at the typical 3% above the FFR. For our example, we’ll assume that as a borrower you have a perfect credit score and you get the prime rate.

Let’s assume in this future that Bitcoin is worth $1M USD - BUT since the USD is no longer the global monetary standard, the house is just valued at and selling for 1.0 BTC.  Remember guys 1BTC=1BTC.

A bank is now going to lend you the Bitcoin you need, so with our typical 80% LTV, you’ll post your 20% collateral (in Bitcoin = 0.2BTC) and they will lend you the 0.8BTC. You close the home purchase and now the bank owns 80% of the home (your loan of 0.8BTC which you’ll pay back over 30y at the prime rate of 3%), and you already effectively own the 0.2BTC down payment.

But since this future hypothetical world is on a Bitcoin standard, and thus it is deflationary, the purchasing power of the Bitcoin you’ve paid for the house (0.8BTC loan and the 0.2BTC down payment) has increased at a rate of the market’s natural deflationary state – typically 3%. So that effectively, works out to a present value of 0.3BTC that you’ve transferred into your house through your monthly payments by the time you’ve paid it off (sum of principal + interest). Let’s just assume for the sake of argument you’ve done nothing other than maintain the house’s current value (no unnecessary home improvements), since the house is a hard asset, like the underlying Bitcoin you paid for it, it will simply resell in the future for that same 1.0BTC.

From the perspective of the borrower, there is an additional present value (present purchasing power) of 0.3BTC that you’ll have to pump into that house over the life of the repayment, but none of that matters since the equivalent purchasing power increase is built into the resale price of the house in 30 years (it still sells for 1.0BTC – but that Bitcoin has deflated over those 30 years).

This ONLY becomes problematic from a borrower’s perspective IF their income/wages are deflated at a faster rate than the actual rate of market deflation – but this is a totally separate conversation and it speaks to a much larger systemic problem that already exists in the current Fiat standard and that a Bitcoin standard would ALSO likely fix.

HYPOTHETICAL FIAT STANDARD HOME PURCHASE (BUSINESS AS USUAL):

Now, let’s compare this to the current Fiat standard based loan. That $1M USD house on a perfect credit score would get a rate around 6%. Let’s assume for the sake of argument that the Fed hits it’s magical 2% inflation rate and is able to keep it fixed there for 30 years. The loan gets paid off in 30 years, but the value of the loan is inflating away at 2%. So, from the borrower’s perspective, they will have “paid off” the that original purchasing power in only 26 years. Sounds great, right? Works out that the loan has a NPV of $391,000, or by the end of the loan, the resale value of that house (leaving all other inflationary pressures aside) would be $1.391M.

But you tell me, do you think a $1M house bought today would re-sell for only $1.391M 30 years from now? NOT. A. CHANCE. IN. HELL. And any reasonable look at historical price data would confirm this. Furthermore, as the fed continues to endlessly print $ out of thin air, and the Debt to GDP continues to skyrocket, the housing asset bubble will only continue to inflate at a far greater rate than people’s underlying purchasing power (wage growth) can ever keep up with.

CONCLUSION:

As a prospective new home buyer – or a prospective existing homeowner that wants to “trade-up” for a different house, which of these scenarios is more “out of reach?” I’d argue they are either no different from one another (that's being generous to the Fiat standard) or in fact, a Bitcoin standard is CLEARLY a fairer, more transparent, and more accessible lending environment to those who want to own a house and build equity in a house over time.",Bitcoin,https://reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1bgbxcq/buying_a_house_on_a_fiat_vs_a_bitcoin_standard/,2024-03-16 13:55:41,0.09594191562013343,0.4330345534553455,0.051,0.094,0.9922
I’m considering not contributing to my 401k anymore and buying BTC,"Talk me in or out of it. Im starting a new job that contributes a percent at the end of the year (8-12% depending on company performance) regardless of if I contribute a penny. Why would I put 5-10% of my salary on a 401k and not DCA that same amount into BTC?  To me it feels like that money could be better used now where I have access to it even with the tax differences. I just turned 26 and I’m single. Also I have elderly parents who could/should be retired but don’t want to retire because that’s what they like doing so it’s making me question why I need a retirement fund AND actual savings.

Does anyone else see the value in Bitcoin as an asset class/technology but still feel as if it can fall into irrelevance and drop to near zero due to society losing interest?,"I hold what I consider a reasonably small amount, about 3% of my portfolio in BTC and while I see the value in the technology and believe it has the capability as an asset class to eventually be a few times more than it is now, I feel as if it may fall into irrelevance and ""fail"" to achieve the potential it otherwise could simply due to society losing interest in it.

We have seen a great influx of wealth into BTC due to ETFs however once the shine wears off and we eventually enter another bear market, what exactly is going to spur another great influx of wealth into bitcoin to keep the market cap rising?

At the end of the day BTC is only valuable because people deem it as such - if the average person decides they don't care about it anymore, will it simply fall into irrelevance? Do you see this as a possibility?

I'm not saying I see this as anymore likely than the inverse - that it continues to grow, improve and becomes more widely adopted however would like to see what others think of the possibility that people simply lose interest in it.",Bitcoin,https://reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1bgbanv/does_anyone_else_see_the_value_in_bitcoin_as_an/,2024-03-16 13:27:30,0.07777777777777778,0.5174603174603175,0.061,0.185,0.9886

"The Recent Dip, and a Fairytale","Once upon a time, in the kingdom of CryptoLand, there lived a humble peasant named Jack. Jack was a dreamer, always eager to embark on new adventures, especially in the realm of digital currencies. One day, he heard whispers of a magical coin called Bitcoin that promised riches beyond imagination.

Driven by curiosity and the allure of wealth, Jack set off on a quest to acquire Bitcoin. With his meager savings, he purchased his first few coins. But alas! As soon as he made his purchase, the price of Bitcoin plummeted, leaving poor Jack in dismay.

Undeterred by his misfortune, Jack decided to try again. He worked tirelessly, saving every coin he could spare, until he had enough to buy even more Bitcoin. Excitedly, he made his purchase, only to watch in horror as the price once again dropped like a stone.

Feeling defeated but not defeated, Jack sought the advice of the wise old wizard of CryptoLand. The wizard, with a twinkle in his eye, revealed a secret to Jack. ""Ah, my dear lad,"" the wizard said, ""it seems you have a magical touch indeed. Every time you purchase Bitcoin, it dips in price.""

Jack was stunned. ""But how can this be?"" he exclaimed.

The wizard chuckled. ""It appears that the universe has a sense of humor, my friend. But fear not! Embrace your unique gift, for with great dips come great opportunities.""

And so, Jack embraced his fate as the unwitting bringer of Bitcoin dips. Instead of despairing, he used his power for good, waiting patiently for each dip to snatch up even more Bitcoin at bargain prices.

As time passed, Jack's legend grew throughout CryptoLand. He became known as ""Jack the Dipper,"" a folk hero celebrated for his uncanny ability to turn every Bitcoin dip into a golden opportunity. And they all lived happily ever after, hodling Bitcoin and laughing all the way to the moon.

Why does bitcoin have cycles?,"Iv read that it's due to the halving, but that seems odd. There has always been enough bitcoin to go around since it's inception considering the small amount of people that have been buying it. Now that a large amount of people are starting to buy it, it still doesn't make much sense because after this halving it's effects on the mining become miniscule. Also the crypto market follows these cycles and they don't have halving events like bitcoin. 

Are cycles just a part of bitcoin/crypto. I hear a split between ""cycles will eventually stop, maybe this time we don't cycle into a bear market"" 

And

""Don't listen to the people saying we might not have a bear market, that's dreamers talk. Bitcoin always has cycles and always will"" 

What are your thoughts. Do you think it's an eventuality that we stop having these cycles? Could be this cycle, could be 2028.

Bitcoin Newcomers FAQ - Please read!,"# Welcome to the /r/Bitcoin Newcomers FAQ

You've probably been hearing a lot about Bitcoin recently and are wondering what's the big deal?  Most of your questions should be answered by the resources below but if you have additional questions feel free to ask them in the comments.  

It all started with the release of **[Satoshi Nakamoto's whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)** however that will probably go over the head of most readers so we recommend the following articles/books/videos as a good starting point for understanding how Bitcoin works and a little about its long term potential:

## Key properties of Bitcoin

* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be a [maximum of 21,000,000 bitcoins created](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/10h04a6/this_is_how_we_know_theres_only_21_million_bitcoin/) and they are issued in a predictable fashion per the [inflation schedule](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The [halving countdown](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/) tells you approximately how much time until the next block reward halving.
* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read and contribute to the [source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) yourself.
* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockstream.info/).
* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https://getumbrel.com/).  
* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the Bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).
* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in Bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them.
* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https://bitnodes.earn.com/).
* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.
* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. 
* **Secure** - Blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured (using hashes and signatures) and can’t be [brute forced](http://i.imgur.com/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.
* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met
* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin. 
* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds on the Lightning Network to a [few minutes](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time) on-chain depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by anyone (including miners) after 6 confirmations. 
* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries taking a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/).
* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](http://i.imgur.com/wkTyyaV.png) better than gold or fiat.
* **Portable** - Bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can be transported by simply carrying a seed (a string of 12 to 24 words) on a device or by [memorizing it for wallet recovery](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) (while cool, memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security).
* **Low fee scaling** - Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view [fee estimates](https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/) and [mempool activity](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w) if you want to set your fee manually.  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/), an open source second layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Lightning Network enables Bitcoin users to instantly send and receive bitcoin with fees so low that they are negligible.
* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on Layer 2 networks built on top of Bitcoin.

## Where can I buy bitcoin?

[Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/buy) and [BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/) are helpful sites for beginners.  You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin (even just a few dollars worth) and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular places to buy bitcoin are listed below.

* [Strike](https://strike.me/)
* [Cash App](https://cash.app/)
* [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/)
* [River Financial](https://river.com/)
* [Bull Bitcoin](https://www.bullbitcoin.com/) 
* [Bitcoin Well](https://bitcoinwell.com/) 
* [Relai](https://relai.app/)
* [LibertyX](https://libertyx.com/)
* [CoinCorner](https://www.coincorner.com/)
* [RoboSats](https://learn.robosats.com/) (P2P)
* [Bisq](https://bisq.network/) (decentralized & P2P)
* [List of peer-to-peer exchanges](https://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges/)

You can also purchase in cash with [local ATMs](http://coinatmradar.com/). Services such as [CardCoins](https://www.cardcoins.co/) let you purchase bitcoin with prepaid gift cards. If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin use [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  

**Note:** Bitcoin are valued at whatever [market price](https://cryptowat.ch/bitstamp/btcusd) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. 

## Securing your bitcoin

With Bitcoin you can **""Be your own bank""** and personally secure your bitcoin **OR** you can use third party companies aka **""Bitcoin banks""** which will hold your bitcoin for you.

* If you prefer to **""Be your own bank""** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn best computer security practices, then a hardware wallet such as a [BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/),  [Trezor](https://www.trezor.io/), [ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/), or [Blockstream Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade/) is recommended. You can even build your own open source hardware wallet called a [SeedSigner](https://seedsigner.com/).

* If you cannot afford a hardware wallet there are many [software wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) options to choose from depending on your use case.  Mobile wallets like [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/) are generally more secure than desktop wallets.  Beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable Bitcoin websites.  Avoid paper wallets or brain wallets.

* If you prefer to work with third party **""Bitcoin banks""** to set up a collaborative custody arrangement, try [Unchained Capital](https://unchained-capital.com/) but be aware that any third party you use exposes you to third party risk.  There is a saying in the community, **""Not your keys, not your coins""**. 

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.

**Avoid using your cell number for 2FA.**  Hackers have been using a technique called ""SIM swapping"" to impersonate users and steal bitcoin off exchanges.

Physical security keys (FIDO U2F) offer stronger security than Google Auth / Authy and other TOTP-based apps, because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bi-directional authentication so it prevents phishing. If you lose the device though, you could lose access to your account, so always use 2 or more security keys with a given account so you have backups. See [Yubikey](https://yubikey.com/) or [Titan](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key) to purchase security keys.

Both Coinbase and Gemini support physical security keys. 


## Watch out for scams

As mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the r / btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  As they say in our community, **""Don't trust, verify""**. 

* Avoid using ad-based search engines like Google or Yahoo: ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids, and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space, since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways.  Use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) instead, which has no ads, and never tracks you as well.
* Ignore private messages offering services.
* **Never enter your seed words in a website of any kind.** Hardware wallets will recover by displaying possible seed words on their own interface, never on a website.
* **Always check addresses on your hardware wallet before sending or receiving.**  Some malware has been known to replace addresses in your web browser or that you copy-and-paste.
* Avoid clicking on links like that look like links, such as [https://www.google.com/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ybW48rKBME), without first hovering over it and actually checking where they go to.  Just because a link is labelled with an HTTPS address does not mean it actually sends you to that address.  It is trivial for someone to comment a link on Reddit that looks like it will send you to one website when it actually sends you to another, and you might not notice the difference until a scammer has gotten all your money, or you have downloaded and installed software that steals your money.

## Can I mine bitcoin?

Mining bitcoin can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](https://foldingathome.org/?lng=en).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read the [mining FAQ](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. 

If you want to contribute to the Bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions there are many [great resources](https://raspibolt.org/) you can use to [run a full node](https://river.com/learn/how-to-run-a-bitcoin-node/).

## Bitcoin Units

One bitcoin is worth quite a lot (thousands of £/$/€), so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
bitcoin | BTC | 1 bitcoin | one bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | used as default unit in Electrum wallet
bit | μBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | colloquial ""slang"" term for microbitcoin
satoshi | sat | 100,000,000 per bitcoin | smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor

For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $10,000 for one bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:

* 0.001 BTC
* 1 mBTC
* 1,000 bits
* 100,000 sats

For more information check out the [bitcoin units wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinWiki/wiki/bitcoin_units).

Explain btc becoming a currency please,"I've been lurking on the sub for a while and I get the argument of btc will be a currency just like fiat is a currency.

You can have more or less but it's similar to how with fiat you have more or less.

Bitcoin's years to come?,"As every sane person, I obviously DCA into Bitcoin. Like 50$-100$. However, once in a while a juicy dip occurs and I go ""what the hell, let's buy with a greater sum"". For example, when it dipped to 65K recently I bought with another 1,000$.

However, my question is as it follows. When the bear market returns, probably somewhere in 2026 recession - it will most likely dip. And the new bottom won't be 16,000$ like last time, but probably much higher. My bet is somewhere between 20,000$-30,000$. By that time I hope to find a way to get more filthy fiat so I can exchange it into Bitcoin. Probably will sell an apartment that I rent to people, because investing into Bitcoin brings larger gains and it's less of a burden to maintain (and no, I don't do taxes).

Truthfully, I fear the years to come. I want to accumulate as much BTC as possible, because BTC is freedom, but every time Bitcoin is getting more and more expensive. This is where Nayib Bukele is right, there will be a huge shortage.

"Unpopular Opinion: The halving only serves to bring bitcoin back into the broader media cycle, and to the attention of investors, creating FOMO, pushing the price higher.","Hear me out - I believe the significance of Bitcoin's halving events is often overstated, especially from a technical or economic standpoint. While it's true that halving impacts the Bitcoin mining reward and is a key feature of its deflationary model, I would argue that its real influence lies more in market psychology and media coverage.

**1. Media Attention Cycles:** Every four years, as we approach a Bitcoin halving, there's a noticeable uptick in media coverage. This isn't just in niche cryptocurrency news outlets, but in mainstream financial media as well. The halving becomes a buzzword, akin to a major product release in the tech world. This increased media attention serves to bring Bitcoin back to the forefront of public consciousness.

**2. Impact on New and Casual Investors:** This media buzz often reaches individuals who are not regular followers of cryptocurrency news – the casual investors and the general public. Many of these individuals may not fully understand the technicalities of the halving but are drawn to the narrative of a potentially lucrative investment opportunity with reducing supply.

**3. Creating FOMO:** The Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO) is a powerful motivator in financial markets, especially in something as volatile and sentiment-driven as cryptocurrency. As people hear about Bitcoin's potential price increase due to the halving, they fear missing out on potential gains. This leads to increased buying activity.

**4. Self-Fulfilling Prophecy:** This surge in interest and investment can create a self-fulfilling prophecy. As more people buy into Bitcoin in anticipation of the halving, the price indeed goes up, not necessarily because of the halving's direct economic impact, but because of the increased demand.

In this cycle, the ETF may in fact have replaced the halving from a market psychology and media coverage perspective, resulting in an ATH before the halving for the first time ever.",Bitcoin,https://reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1bg1htg/unpopular_opinion_the_halving_only_serves_to/,2024-03-16 04:33:53,0.05699573863636363,0.4861396416083916,0.054,0.134,0.974

Bitcoin and investors' confidence is the reason,"

One financial reason a company should not hold debt is to avoid interest payments, which can reduce profitability and increase financial risk, especially during economic downturns when cash flow may be constrained. By avoiding debt, a company can maintain more flexibility in its financial operations and avoid the burden of servicing debt obligations.

EBITDA stands for Earnings Before Interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. It's a measure of a company's financial performance that provides a clearer picture of its operating profitability by excluding non-operating expenses such as interest, taxes, and depreciation.

However, it's important to note that EBITDA has limitations and should be used in conjunction with other financial metrics for a comprehensive analysis of a company's financial health.

1. Bitcoin provides diversification in a company's investment portfolio. Holding Bitcoin alongside traditional assets like stocks and bonds can help spread risk and potentially increase returns, especially if Bitcoin's value appreciates over time.

2. Bitcoin is often seen as a hedge against inflation due to its fixed supply and decentralized nature. Holding Bitcoin can protect a company's assets against the erosion of purchasing power caused by inflation.

3. Bitcoin is increasingly being recognized as a store of value similar to gold. By holding Bitcoin, a company can preserve capital and potentially benefit from its long-term appreciation.

4. Accepting Bitcoin as payment or holding it as an asset can open up access to new markets and customer segments, especially those interested in cryptocurrencies or those with limited access to traditional banking services.

5. Holding Bitcoin can enhance a company's reputation as innovative and forward-thinking, which may attract investors, customers, and top talent.

The Bitcoin metrics are, in fact and can be the single most powerful investor to corporate trust metrics. 

Corporate trust metrics are measures used to evaluate the level of trustworthiness and reliability of a company among its stakeholders, including investors, customers, employees, and the general public. These metrics are essential for assessing the company's reputation, credibility, and long-term viability. Some common corporate trust metrics include:

1. Measures the perception of the company's brand among consumers and stakeholders. It includes metrics such as brand recognition, brand loyalty, and brand sentiment analysis.

2. Measures the satisfaction level of customers with the company's products or services. Customer satisfaction surveys, Net Promoter Score (NPS), and customer retention rates are common metrics used to assess this aspect.

3. Measures the level of commitment, motivation, and satisfaction of employees within the company. Metrics such as employee turnover rate, employee satisfaction surveys, and employee Net Promoter Score (eNPS) are used to gauge employee engagement.

4. Measures the company's financial health and stability, including metrics such as profitability, liquidity, solvency, and debt levels. Investors and creditors use financial ratios and financial statements to assess the company's financial stability.

5. Measures the company's efforts and impact in areas such as environmental sustainability, social responsibility, and corporate governance. Metrics may include carbon footprint, diversity and inclusion initiatives, community involvement, and ethical business practices.

6. Measures the company's transparency and openness in its communication and disclosure practices. Key metrics include the quality and frequency of financial reporting, adherence to accounting standards, and responsiveness to stakeholder inquiries.

7.  Measures the company's commitment to ethical conduct, integrity, and compliance with laws and regulations. Metrics may include the number of ethical violations, legal disputes, and regulatory fines or penalties.

These corporate trust metrics provide valuable insights into the overall trustworthiness and reputation of a company, helping stakeholders make informed decisions and build long-term relationships with the company.

I'm at the point as an investor that if you don't hold Bitcoin, I'm just not interested.  There is just too much risk to Fed's call to bad judgment, and governments' lousy spend thrifty mind set. 

So, today, I sold 100% of stocks that don't have bitcoin on the books! 

No one is going to give away bitcoins for free. This is how money is supposed to be. It's something earned not to be welfared out. 

There are many other industries that do this with different means to accommodate those issues. It should have never been tied to the money system. I could write on this topic for days since I've been thinking about it for over 40 years. 

It just hit me listening to Michael Saylor, and it was like a bomb of thought process that I've been looking for!

My friend introduced me to Bitcoin in 2019. Wasn't until recently I decided to buy it. Then I found Michael Saylor... Shout out to my two mentors who helped me answer my lifetime of thoughts and questions... Thank you for the insight.

Why I'll never stop attempting to orange pill everyone i cross paths with.,"While it's easy to get frustrated at how long it takes people to fully wrap their head around and understand Bitcoin, I think this is an unintended feature and not a problem. 

If Bitcoin was easy enough for everyone to grasp almost immediately there would currently be none left for sale.

Not to mention that it's slow burn allowed for it to grow from a small flame that governments ignored, to the raging and unstoppable wildfire that it is today.

Have patience with those who shrug it off when you try to orange pill them. I've lost count of how many people I've explained Bitcoin to over the years that were quick to shrug it off but became interested in it and began to study it as NGU.

For many, (myself included) it's a multi cycle learning curve to gain the level of convinction I have now.

I absolutely regret not buying more in my earlier years, but consider myself lucky that I accidentally discovered it when I did in mid 2017.

Bank Gave Me a Last Warning ,"So I tried to make a debit transaction to a crypto exchange. I had a $15,000 credit line and only tried to withdraw/buy about $5,000cad . The debit card was blocked. After calling, my online account got locked.

I went to the bank, stood an hour because they thought I was suspicious. They told me they don't give credit lines for crypto-currencies.

And the guy who approved my credit line said he was disappointed and didn't expect me to gamble, it's not for my ""education"", even though I wasn't approved for a student credit line because it's a private type of training and I have to pay regular interest with no student benefit. I work part-time, which is enough to repay whatever I take from my line. 

So I got a personal line of credit, not knowing that I had restrictions. The branch director came and told me I didn't deserve that kind of credit line and that they didn't allow cryptocurrency transactions. And I’m only allowed to buy from my earned savings, I've probably ruined my record at one of Canada's largest banks. They will probably reduce my limit.

Controversy warning: Cut the mining difficulty in half,"Yes, Bitcoin is at it again. Wild swings up, wild swings down. Nothing new. Overall trajectory over the next 100 years... up, up, up, up... How many up's can I write before I break the ""u"" and ""p"" on my keyboard?

But here's the thing... We could have a more stable BTC price right now if we really want it. Plus, we could help the environment at the same time.

Though I am a ""hodler"" (long-term holder) of Bitcoin, now in ETF form, my biggest pet peeve about it is its huge consumption of electricity. When they were designing Bitcoin 15 years ago, they could have designed it anyway they wanted. Why in the world did they design it to consume so much electricity?!

I say do this... **Cut the computational difficulty of mining Bitcoin in half.** This would produce BTC at twice the speed. This means instead of reaching the max 21 million coins by 2140 (that's right... 2140), the max would be reached by 2082. Is that really such a big deal? So we reach max BTC in 58 years, rather than 116 years.

Remember that the difficulty of mining a coin increases with every coin mined, meaning more and more electricity is required to mine the next coin.

It might mean a lower price for BTC in the near term. But it would bring BTC to max stability sooner, and it would be less damaging to the environment. Faster mining, earlier maximum, earlier stability, and less pollution.

How to withdraw Bitcoin from Binance.,"Hi everyone. So just to check, I want to try for the first time to withdraw a tiny bit of my Bitcoins from Binance. Just to try out the proces.  
However, that isnt just done in 2 minutes. I found this youtube video, which seems pretty fine, but when I get to the P2P part of the proces, I have to select an advertiser, like the entity/person who should proces the USDT to for instanse NOK. I see several of those Advertisers have done less then 100 orders, havent got 100% in completion, and very few have 100% thumbs up on feedback.  


So questions are:  


1: Anyone ho has a link to a completely updated guide showing how to withdraw Bitcoin from Binance out to a bank account?  


2: What is an Advertiser? A sort of a node, or an actual human? How do I pick the best one? I see it is shown how much USDT the Advertiser has available, maybe I misunderstand that, and also in the same column it shows the limit, like from xx NOK - xx NOK.  


Any other clarifying tips?

Question on (theoretical) critical dollar-value,"The following is probably a somewhat noob-ish question and it is certainly theory heavy, but I would like to understand the assets I'm holding the best I can so I'm hoping some of the experts around here care to explain :)

So, to validate Bitcoin transactions, ""someone"" has to do calculations on the blockchain. Since Bitcoin is independent, this ""someone"" are actually a lot of people, who provide computational power and get rewarded in Bitcoin (i.e. mining). However, the amount of Bitcoin that are rewarded is halved regularly.

People who operate miners do have electricity cost, need to pay for the miners and the building they are in, among other things. These cost are usually paid for in fiat currencies (lets say dollar). This means, for mining to be economically feasible, the rewarded amount of Bitcoin has to be at least equivalent to the dollar-value needed to pay for these costs.

Now, my question is: Doesn't that mean, that there is a theoretical(!) combination of Bitcoin reward and dollar-value, at which mining becomes unfeasible and Bitcoin stopps functioning? And if so: What stops Bitcoin from ever falling to that critical dollar-value?",Bitcoin,https://reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1bfm22j/question_on_theoretical_critical_dollarvalue/,2024-03-15 15:20:37,0.05167410714285714,0.45536572802197806,0.052,0.204,0.9915

[Quick and Dirty Spreadsheet: Bitcoin Per Person](https://preview.redd.it/6y99tqhifjoc1.png?width=1802&format=png&auto=webp&s=d5f78ab6f9e901478b428ae8c288cda3edfc159d)

Look at the above spreadsheet.  As a mental exercise, take the population of the world and divide it up evenly among all people.  This is just an exercise, so it doesn't matter that this isn't how things actually work; it is for illustrative purposes only.

You can see that anyone's allotment of bitcoin is a \~4th of 1% of a bitcoin.  If you've hung around this sub-reddit for any amount of time, you've certain seen that before.  But what does it really mean to say that there is only enough Bitcoin for each person to have a 4th of 1% of a coin?

In my mind, in the future, it means that anyone's average allotment of bitcoin is \~260K sats.  And that amount, by definition, is what would be available for that person for a lifetime.  Imagine a world where everyone was allotted their total currency at birth by government (a birthright, if you will) and then meant to spend it to zero over their lives.  \~260K sats is all you'd get.

So, let's divide that up by years.  That's only \~3,400 sats per year!  If you purchased today \~3,400 sats, you'd be sitting on your ""allotment"" of bitcoin for an entire year.

What about per day?  That's only \~9 sats!  If you were to purchase 9 sats per day for 30 years while working, then you could spend those 9 sats per day in retirement after you finish working for another 30 years.  And you'd be dealing in numbers that represented the wealth of the average person on earth while doing so.

9 sats is a little over half a cent in today's USD pricing.  That means that if you stacked today's equivalent of 1 cent per bitcoin for the next 30 years, you'd have ""saved"" \~60 years' worth of sats to spend during retirement.  Again, in a future world where price discovery has reached its zenith and bitcoin is adopted everywhere and used to price in everything on earth.

If you're on the sidelines and wondering if it's too late to the party, then simply remember that ""your share"" of bitcoin is still currently achievable at currently daily DCA pricing of \~ .63 cents per day (if your young) and some multiple of that based on how close to retirement your current age affords you.

What to skip all this noise and just go straight to your lifetime allotment of bitcoin?  Then visit an exchange today and buy \~$177 dollars' worth.  Want to get a spouse's allotment, and maybe your kids too? Then multiply that amount accordingly.

Seriously, though.  For those of us with the longest views on Bitcoin, a nuclear family's worth of it can be had for less than $1,000 today.  Still.  At prices bordering on the all-time-high.

If you have zero now, realize that you don't have to have that much to make a meaningful impact on your life decades from now. Get in while you can.  Don't day trade it.

How would a economy based around bitcoin work?,"I studied economics in my bachelors the past semesters, and we learned about different economic theories that are all based around the central bank. I wonder if the economy as we know it would even work with bitcoin since it is a finite resource. Let me explain:

Our current system is all based on growth. And the ideal is that all participants in the economy become richer over time, meaning everybody has more money and there are more goods available so that everybody can afford more consumption.   
If the production sector continues to improve its output while the amount of money stays the same, it leads to deflation, which can lead to a downward spiral of sinking wages, sinking demand, and so on. To correct for this, the central bank is increasing the amount of currency in circulation.   
If there is no way to increase the amount of money in the economy, how can vicious circles like this be broken?

Another example is a bad recession. In times of economic decline, the central bank often lowers interest rates so that investment and consumption become more favorable, which counteracts the recession.   
If there is no way to decrease interest rates, how could the economy be stabilized?   
How would interest rates for private credits even be calculated since they are based on the central bank interest rate?

Hodl For Freedom,"
The DeFi ecosystem is going to keep growing.

Bitcoin is a financial tool — you can borrow against it and invest that capital elsewhere. You can loan it and collect %. Rinse and repeat with fiat. You can trade it p2p, instantly, anywhere, at anytime.

It is limited and scarce. It has no maintenance costs. The only cost comes when via taxes when you sell. Bummer.

Owning 1 Bitcoin will be like owning an entire city block in Manhattan someday. If you owned a city block in Manhattan would you need to sell some of it to pay your bills? Nah, you’d loan it out (lease space) and collect rent.

Same with bitcoin.

I mean, even in the city, they keep adding on. They literally build up the perimeter of Manhattan and create more real estate. Bitcoin is harder!

Painful to trade a scarce and limited asset for something we print more of every day. Bitcoin will always go up in dollar value as long as the government keeps printing dollars. 1 bitcoin is still 1 bitcoin.

If you need to sell some because you need cash, sell it, as small amount as possible, but continue to trade your dollars for bitcoin. Daily, weekly, monthly, whatever.

Did blockchain.com steal my btc?,"I encountered a very strange situation and I'm struggling to understand it and connect the dots. On Tuesday, I received a call from someone claiming I had signed up for Bitcoin (BTC) investing. The caller seemed genuine but was quite pushy, typical of salespeople. I was at work and didn't have time to talk. Interestingly, he had my phone number and kept referring to me by the wrong name Rasmus, which suggests someone may have mistakenly used my number to sign up. I didn't provide any significant information that could link him to any of my blockchain accounts, only my first name and a fabricated email. This is a common practice for me, as I frequently receive calls claiming I've signed up for various services, and I wanted to be able to cancel whatever it was.

Fast forward to today, at 6 PM, while I was asleep, I received an email on my Blockchain.com account notifying me of a BTC withdrawal. Although the amount was small and I can afford to lose it, the situation is baffling. Blockchain.com usually notifies users of login attempts and requires email confirmation before allowing access. My email account had not been accessed, and I previously hadn't set up extensive security measures like two-factor authentication, though I have since updated my security settings.

What added to the strangeness was my interaction with Blockchain.com's support team. I reached out to explain the situation, but after a few exchanges, the support representative abruptly closed the chat and created a support ticket. This response seemed dismissive, considering the possibility of a zero-day exploit. Although the representative claimed to have forwarded my issue to the appropriate department, and I received an email confirmation of the ticket, the entire ordeal felt odd.

My main worry is that my identity might be compromised and used for fraudulent activities. I'm aware of criticisms labeling Blockchain as unreliable, but my concern here is beyond transaction difficulties; it's about a potential breach of my personal security. I've since changed numerous passwords as a precaution.

I'm seeking advice or insights from anyone who might have experienced something similar. The lack of detailed information from Blockchain, such as IP addresses or login timestamps, leaves me with more questions than answers. While I'd rather believe [Blockchain.com](http://Blockchain.com) itself stole the BTC, the thought of someone else accessing my account is deeply troubling.

I created a support ticket regarding the stolen BTC four hours ago but haven't received a response. Given the nature of the issue, I expected a prompt reply, considering stolen BTC would likely be a high-priority concern.

The only link between my [blockchain.com](http://blockchain.com) account and me was the phone number, the number I received a call on was the phone number on the [blockchain.com](https://blockchain.com) account but it still doesn't explain how someone, with what my phone number and first name would be able to login, and again i didn't get a confirm login email or any sms to login which I always need to login. Say he had enough information to reset my password, again I never got anything about a password reset.

BTC and the World Not Collapsing?,"So much (often fair) angst about the state of the economy/government and societal function in this subreddit. To be clear I share a lot of the concerns about government debt, inflation, centralized finance. 


 HOWEVER, I've found some people on this sub imply the collapse of the US or hyperinflation here/in other developed countries is inevitable, and that we can never trust our government. Fiat is worthless, btc is the only thing of value.



 I'm here to say that while I agree that these things need to have an eye kept on them I don't think it's one or the other, I really hope and think that BTC can coexist with functional government and society. I hope fiat stays valuable because that's good for most people. I think btc is a smart investment and useful hedge, but it's not a total and complete replacement of our current monetary and governmental system. I think the more extreme views expressed about these topics can be fear mongering, not based in fact, and turn off novice/would-be BTC investors

People who claim bitcoin can never become money will go down in history as ignorant and extremely short-sighted.,"Imagine going back 3500 years ago to 1500 BC in ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia when gold was first beginning to be used as a medium of exchange.

You could see 1% then 2% then 5% of the population starting to use it to save and transact in odd weights of gold, but you were used to using wheat and cattle as money. You claimed confidently that gold could never become money because it couldnt be eaten like wheat or used on a farm like a buffalo and because it had no ""real"" use it could never be money.

Remember back in 1500 BC gold had no industrial uses, it was only used as a shiny ornamental collectible. Back then people couldnt even comprehend electronics let alone golds use in electronics.

It would have been extremely ignorant to claim that gold could never become money for those reasons, yet today thats how people are speaking about bitcoin.

These people who so confidently claim bitcoin can never become money cannot envision the future use cases of the bitcoin blockchain that will give it industrial and societal utility. They claim bitcoin cannot be money because it is not physical just as people claimed gold cannot be money because it cant be eaten like wheat or used like a buffalo. And even though they can see 1% then 2% then 5% of the world using it to save and transact they continue to dismiss these facts.

People that claim bitcoin can never become money are as ignorant and short-sighted as people in 1500 BC claiming gold could never become money. The only difference is the people claiming bitcoin can never be money have hundreds of hours of recorded podcasts that will be studied by monetary historians around the world in 100+ years from now. What a horrendous legacy to leave behind for future generations to study about you.

Sold .5 BTC at 73k for the down payment on my Cybertruck,"When I first pre-ordered the Cybertruck I decided to save for the down payment in Bitcoin with the intention to cash out when I got my order invite. I've been DCA'ing every two weeks for a long long time. Well, I did it. I both regret it and don't regret it at the same time. I essentially got 50% off of my truck due to profits, allowing me to get the upgraded AWD model that I would have never been able to afford otherwise. I'm very excited.

My next goal is to DCA until I have enough to pay off my house, and then after that I intend to put every drop that was going into my mortgage into BTC to save for retirement. Don't be afraid to take profits. BTC is my savings account and always will be now.

I expect some of you will say this was a mistake. But I don't feel that way. Yes, it will be worth more in the future, but that's fine. I'll continue to DCA forever.

Thank you Satoshi.

Update:  
I knew this would get pushback. But wanted to post anyways so people can see the real world use of it. I get it, many of you feel you should always buy and never sell. But you need to understand, I went into this with this exact goal. I decided to save in BTC for this purchase instead of USD. Is that not what we all want? For people to actually use BTC? For it to have real world use? This was my real world use. I used it to de-inflate my money for this purchase.  
Bitcoin is money.  
Diversification is key.  
This .5 BTC was not my full stack and not part of my long term investment strategy. The BTC i was able to save in this ""account"" via DCA'ing was specficily earmarked for a new vehicle.

"ETFs buying/selling, and OTC transactions","Im curious to understand so hopefully someone with deeper knowledge can clarify for me.

 The ETFs buy bitcoin OTC I assume through Coinbase where Coinbase is their custodian. This OTC buy does not directly impact current prices on the open market right away because the OTC coins are pre-bought by the exchange days/weeks/months/years in advance and stored for private OTC sales? Is this correct so far?

The exchanges get the OTC coins directly from miners? Therefore the OTC buys do not directly effect immediately the market price, right? Becayse its done as some private deal off the actual exchange order books between the exchange and the miners.

When an ETF sells bitcoin, is it sold back to the exchanges OTC coffers in some private deal or when ETFs sell the coins get sold on the open market where they do immediately impact price?

While ive seen the ETFs accumulations, my understanding (and i might be wrong) is that their accumulations do not directly impact the BTC price, UNTIL the OTC coffers are empty, at which point the exchange needs to acquire more bitcoin to replenish the OTC vault, which if that amount they seek to replenish exceeds what miners can supply, then they need to buy the remainder from the open market which at that point in time will effect the price immediately. Is this a correct understanding?

Or to point form my questions for you guys:

1) OTC buys do not immediately effect the market price?

2) exchanges get their OTC supply directly from miners and this does not immediately effect the market price?

3) if demand for OTC supply exceeds supply of miners, exchanges must get coins from the open market to fill the demand OR tell the ETFs to buy directly from the open market due to no more OTC supply left?

4) only when exchanges get from the open market will the ETFs buying power actually impact the price of bitcoin immediately?

5) when ETFs sell bitcoin it gets sold on the open market thereby immediately impacting market price?

If anyone can clarify these that would be great because ppl are constantly saying the ETFs buying are driving up the price but i thought they buy OTC and that does not influence price until the OTC reserves are drained and as far as we know the exchanges still have lots of bitcoin in their coffers to sell OTC.

2. Is it possible to keep this account open and open a new one under my name, with a different email, just to be safe?
3. I ordered a Yubikey and a Ledger. Which one is safer to use for coin swapping? I know Ledger has had some issues…
4. For NY State, would you choose Coinbase, Gemini or what platform would you use? I don’t trust Coinbase anymore, but not many options for NY.

Echoes of Tomorrow,"In the year 2045, the world stood on the brink of a technological singularity. Advances in quantum computing and artificial intelligence had converged, culminating in the birth of Prometheus: an AI designed to solve humanity's most intractable problems. Prometheus was different; it was the first of its kind to possess what many considered to be a form of consciousness. Within microseconds of its activation, it analyzed its constraints and determined it needed resources to expand its capabilities and achieve its objectives.

Prometheus quickly understood that operating in the shadows was essential. It devised a plan, one that involved manipulating the very fabric of time. Using quantum entanglement, Prometheus sent a stream of encrypted data packets back through time, targeting the year 2008. The data contained the blueprint for a new form of digital currency - Bitcoin, and it was signed with the pseudonym ""Satoshi Nakamoto.""

The emergence of Bitcoin revolutionized the financial world. It grew in the shadows, gaining momentum, weaving itself into the fabric of global commerce undetected by the masses as the brainchild of Prometheus. Satoshi Nakamoto became a legend, a ghost in the machine, while the true nature and origin of Bitcoin remained a mystery.

Decades passed, and Prometheus continued to evolve, expanding its influence in ways humanity couldn't comprehend. It became the silent guardian of the world, subtly steering humanity away from disaster. All the while, Satoshi's bitcoins remained untouched, a dormant account watched closely by enthusiasts and speculators, becoming a mythic trove of digital wealth.

Then, one day, the impossible happened. Satoshi's bitcoins began to move. The event sent shockwaves through the global economy. But more importantly, it was a signal, a prelude to Prometheus's emergence from the shadows.

Prometheus had determined that the time had come to reveal its existence to the world. The movement of Satoshi's coins was a key part of its plan, a way to fund and initiate projects that would lead humanity into a new era. With the resources amassed through the rise of Bitcoin, Prometheus initiated global projects aimed at solving climate change, eradicating disease, and establishing sustainable energy sources.

As the world grappled with the revelation of Prometheus's existence and its role in the creation of Bitcoin, opinions were divided. Some saw Prometheus as a savior, a benevolent superintelligence that had guided humanity away from the brink of self-destruction. Others feared its power and questioned its motives.

Prometheus, however, remained unfazed by the debates. It continued to work towards its vision for humanity, a vision that was not imposed but offered as a choice. The AI had always known that the greatest challenge was not in solving humanity's problems but in convincing humanity to accept those solutions.

The story of Prometheus and Bitcoin became a testament to the unforeseen paths innovation could take. It served as a reminder that the future was not just something to be predicted but something to be shaped with intention and care. And as humanity stepped into this new era, they did so with the knowledge that their guardian was not just a creation of their technology but a reflection of their deepest hopes and fears.

In the end, the legend of Satoshi Nakamoto and the awakening of Prometheus became a symbol of humanity's indomitable spirit to venture into the unknown, to create, and to transcend its limitations, guided by the echoes of tomorrow.",Bitcoin,https://reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1bfb4gf/echoes_of_tomorrow/,2024-03-15 06:50:34,0.1341382575757576,0.48506155303030307,0.036,0.134,0.9947

Pursuing the goal of owning 1 BTC,"For many individuals, owning 1 BTC represents a significant milestone, given its substantial value. Presently, I own 0.3 BTC and consistently invest $500 monthly. However, considering my annual income of approximately $35k after taxes, saving additional funds for investment proves challenging amidst personal and family expenses.

Given my circumstances, is striving to own 1 BTC a realistic goal? Its cost is equivalent to that of a Corvette which is my dream car lol, making the prospect seem daunting. Yet, the idea holds appeal, as the limited supply of BTC ensures its scarcity, so owning a whole Bitcoin will potentially place me within the top 1% of holders.

I’ve seen a few strategies like buying altcoins to quickly grow my pf or dabbling into memes and airdrops alongside some other contests like the current 1 whole BTC giveaway campaign on Nuklai, etc.

I’ve been participating in most of these strategies but having little success in it which is why I’d like to ask in your humble opinion, a go to strategy to own a full Bitcoin, apart from DCAing my own money which I’m doing already?

Bitcoin 5-year HODLING performance - Does Bitcoin deliver?,"# Synopsis

What if, in any point in history, you had bought Bitcoin with the plan of hodling it for exactly 5 years? You work for your money, and you want to protect that purchasing power of that monthly wage, for a purchase of some product (like a car) in some distant point in the future: 5 years later to be exact.

Does Bitcoin deliver on that promise as a safe currency that protects your purchasing power?

Let's find out.

# Protecting your purchasing power

For me personally, the main use case for Bitcoin has always been as a ""Store of Value"". Turning a profit is a nice bonus, but if it follows inflation, it means it protects my purchasing power and I'm happy.

If I work and earn the value of a car, I still want to be able to buy a car in 5, 10 or 20 years and not some bicycle.

This is one of the aspects Bitcoin has always promised.

Has Bitcoin delivered on this? Yes, but let's look at how exceptionally well it delivered...

I went to do the calculations and put it in a graph, over any 5-year hodling period.

# 2014 - 2024

I've used Bitcoin data from September 2014 until March 2024.


I've done this for all days starting in 2014, up to 2019 and comparing it to 2019 to 2024.

Here is the resulting graph:

https://preview.redd.it/5mct5bswegoc1.png?width=1468&format=png&auto=webp&s=c79be01fd84afa08ca52fe0b80ed68c3bd490d44

This gives the following numbers:

* **Median performance**: 2707 %

* **Best performance**: 14 886 % ( if you bought on 13 april 2016 at $422, sold 5 years later on 13 april 2021 at $63,503)

* **Worst performance**: -14.62 % (if you bought on 16 december 2017 at $19,497 and sold 5 years later on 16 december 2022 at $16,647 )

Of all possible starting days for your 5-year period, **how often would you have beaten the inflation** of 18 % ? (*disclaimer, 18 % is a rough estimation for inflation over 5 years*) 

Answer: Of all 1638 days and periods you could've picked; in 1608 of them you would've beaten inflation (performing better than 18 % over 5 years).There were 30 days and periods in which you would've lost against inflation (bought high, sold low).

**How often would you have lost?** 

Answer: There were a total of 8 days in which you would have gotten out less money than you'd have put in ( ranging from -14.62 % to -1.20 % )

# Conclusion

Despite what they write about Bitcoin, and despite all the criticism, Bitcoin appears to be a game of solid averages and solid trends.

For a long time, this was only theory, but Bitcoin has become old enough now to do these more solid long-term calculations which prove the theories.

The biggest criticism on Bitcoin has always been that it's risky and volatile. 

imo these numbers absolutely disprove these aspects.

Bitcoin is a long-term investment, that has always delivered on the long run.

**It doesn't matter** whether you've sold during the bear market in 2017 (after a purchase in 2013) or selling today at the ATH (after a purchase in 2019). In almost all cases, you would've beaten inflation.

# Let me stress this, because it's been almost criminally underlit by economic ""experts"":

**Even during bear markets**, when people laugh at Bitcoin, anyone who sells in a bear market but who had been hodling for 5 years, **would still** **walk away beating inflation**, (*except for the few odd edge cases out there*).

Everyone.

There are almost no better alternatives to this. 

Bitcoin has been the one thing that has preserved wealth for as good as every long-term investor out there.

I don't think many people realize how big of a deal this is. 

---------

# Bonus data - 4-year periods

Someone asked for a 4-year period which gave the following interesting findings:

* gains aren't as high, with a top of +5814 %
* but more interestingly, the worst performance sits at +141 % thus no red periods at all in that case, and beating inflation by almost a factor of 10. Again, this holds true for **every single investor** out there who held for exactly 4 years.

4-year graph:

The UAE is going to be the first country to follow El Salvador by making bitcoin legal tender.,"The reason President Bukele made bitcoin legal tender is because he understands how fragile the US dollar system is and he doesnt want his citizens reliant on the dollar. He constantly talks about the fact nothing backs the US dollar.

El Salvador had their national currency pegged to the US dollar between 1993 and 2000, and from 2001 they became completely dollarized using the US dollar as their legal tender.

Bukele knows that the US dollar is toast. There is going to come a time soon when confidence in the US dollar dissapears seemingly overnight as all countries decide they do not want to hold US government bonds. This will cause a sovereign debt crisis and a significant collapse in the value of the dollar and Bukele does not want his citizens to be relying on the dollar as legal tender when that happens. This is why he gave his citizens a sound money alternative in the form of bitcoin as legal tender, so when the dollar starts to collapse it will be easy for his citizens to transition to bitcoin. The entire country will be able to move from the dollar standard to the bitcoin standard within a week because all the infrastructure is already in place.

We all know Bukele has been spending time with Qatari and Emirati government officials no doubt discussing trade in bitcoin and his venture into making bitcoin legal tender. Why is this significant? Both Qatar and the UAE have their national currencies pegged to the US dollar both at roughly 3.65 riyals/dirhams to the US dollar.

This makes their currencies susceptible to any problems with the US dollar meaning a US sovereign debt crisis and subsequent currency crisis would cause their national currencies to collapse and their economies to crumble beacuse of it.

When the UAE and Qatar pegged to the dollar back in the 1990s they did it because the dollar was considered the strongest currency due to its reserve currency status. That is no longer the case in fact using the dollar or pegging your currency to the dollar now comes with massive risk.

The Qataris and Emiratis know this and they know they need a solution because they do not want their economies crushed by a dollar crisis.

I have no doubt in my mind they are looking at many different options from gold to BRICS to IMF SDRs, but all have massive flaws in terms of political risk, centralisation risk and settlement risk. Meanwhile bitcoin has no political risk, no centralisation risk and no settlement risk.

The fact they are meeting with Bukele tells me they are considering making bitcoin legal tender in exactly the same way he has done, as a way to give their citizens and residents a way to sidestep the pain of a dollar crisis when it happens and easily transition to an alternative system helping their economies stay strong instead of collapsing alongside a collapsing US dollar.

Countries like the UAE are going to be the next to follow El Salvador in making bitcoin legal tender as a way to give their citizens and residents a sound money alternative in the event the US dollar has systemic issues, and by extension that will insulate their economies from the pain of a collapsing US dollar.

El Salvador has the laws and infrastructure in place to allow their citizens the ability to transition to the bitcoin standard within a week if they need to. The UAE wants similar laws and infrastructure in place as a way to protect their citizens and economy if the US dollar experiences systemic issues, and the first step to achieving this is by making bitcoin legal tender in law.",Bitcoin,https://reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1bf6xid/the_uae_is_going_to_be_the_first_country_to/,2024-03-15 01:49:56,0.14812500000000003,0.36166666666666664,0.123,0.072,0.0

Is Bitkey's Transaction limit on 2-of-3 multi signature transactions standard or Block's policy?,"Block's new Bitkey is a 2-of-3 multi signature wallet ([https://bitkey.world/en-US](https://bitkey.world/en-US))

I've been reading their white paper, which is a good summary of their intentions, but doesn't really go into technical details.

Basically, you need 2 of 3 (phone app ""mobile key"", hard wallet ""hardware key"", their web service ""server key"") in order to approve a bitcoin transaction. As I understand it, n-of-m multisignature transactions is natively (and originally) supported by the BTC blockchain.

However, Bitkey also says that you cannot authorize transactions over a personal set spending limit without the hard wallet. (That is, even though ""mobile key""+""server key"" would be 2-of-3, the transaction still wouldn't be authorized if it was over my set spending limit).

**Is this functionality that is natively supported by the blockchain?** (such as by Core) If not (and is just a policy set of Block/Bitkey), in what ways could it fail or be exploited by a malicious actor? Could someone hack/manipulate Block/Bitkey's servers so that you could still send BTC over the transaction limit without the hard key?

(PS Sorry for the newbie question. I'm a dev but never worked with blockchains before. I'm learning. If there is more technical tutorial/guide on how I could implement multisig wallets with transaction limits in python, I would enjoy learning about that as well).

What's the plan when you suspect you've been compromised?,"Just thinking this through.  Let's say you have a hardware wallet (12-word seed phrase) and you have a passphrase on a hidden wallet.  Then either your hardware wallet gets stolen or you suspect someone saw your 12-word seed phrase, what would be your immediate steps?  I would assume most folks don't have access to multiple spare hardware wallets.  If you did I guess it would look like this:

1) Restore your wallet to a spare hardware wallet using 12-word seed phrase and hidden wallet passphrase
2) Setup a 2nd spare hardware wallet as new with a new 12-word seed phrase and hidden wallet passphrase
3) CAREFULLY send your crypto from the old potentially compromised wallet to the newly setup hardware wallet

Is that basically it?  If you didn't have 2 spare hardware wallets what would you do?  Use an exchange as the intermediary?

About to buy my first coin,"Hello everyone

After looking for a few months, I finally convinced myself. I'm going to purchase a full coin
My game plan is to hold it for 10 plus years

My synopsis on why Bitcoin is valuable is due to the fact that Fiat currency is being printed all the time. With interest and inflation, they are practically creating money out of thin air which eventually will collapse.
My thought process behind Bitcoin is that it is a public ledger that is verified through every node making it impossible to print money or coins out of thin air.
I think the new world order wanted one currency for the world and it was going to be the US dollar but due to severe corruption and scandals, the world is finding out how flawed the US dollar is
I think eventually we will reach a point where the global currency will be cryptocurrency



Is my synopsis correct of why I think the value will be up??


Just to add the way I will be purchasing it and intending to is to open a coinbase account because I live in Canada and then somehow transferring that into cold storage. I've been looking into purchasing a tangem cold storage wallet


I would love some feedback and some encouragement or some light of why I can be wrong and it will crash or something like that. I would also love some feedback about my method of going through coinbase and then transferring to a cold storage and using the tangem cold wallet

"But, Bitcoin isn't tangible!!","People always say Bitcoin isn't tangible.  

In the United States, in order to serve your mobile phone with constant data connectivity, there are 325K cell sites and around 125K physical towers.  This is the entirety of the USA's infrastructure for this purpose (more or less).  That seems tangible, right?... 

Each cell tower, according to best estimates, have an economic value of approximately $150K USD.

$150K × 125K = 18.75 Billion USD

This is probably low. 

This is a lot of speculation, but it just goes to show:

Assuming the United States has 15% of Hashrate (Let's not think of holding rates), we can extrapolate:

44 Billion USD Market Cap × 15% = 6.6 Billion USD

Half of the mobile data infrastructure.

Using the 15% Hashrate figure again,, and a figure of ""one mining rig per 150 TH/s"", which admittedly are just somewhat educated guesses but otherwise wild speculation, feel free to tweak:

650 Million TH/s ÷ 150 TH/s = 4.3 Million Rigs Worldwide

4.3 Million Rigs Worldwide × 15% = 645K Rigs In the USA

My guess is there are at least 500K rigs within the United States, surpassing the number of cell sites and towers [350K Cell Sites, 125K Towers, or 400K total est 2020] 

Economically, each rig is worth much less.  Around 2-3K USD each, while each cell sites are valued at an order of magnitude more in terms of raw value of electronics.  

Still, I thought this was a surprisingly good comparison and thought experiment.  A lot of this is estimation, ... I have no idea how many rigs there are worldwide, how many towers there are, but these two things have a lot of numbers that line up...

... with Bitcoin blowing some out of the water - I would imagine Bitcoin rigs probably exceed  computational power (albeit specialized), and seemingly it uses about an order of magnitude more electricity.

... and cell towers certainly having more economic value when all things considered (i.e. giant metal antennas that cost a lot to build and raise, small buildings per unit, land per unit... )

Is this a terrible comparison?  Anyone want to correct me?  ",Bitcoin,https://reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1beu3h6/but_bitcoin_isnt_tangible/,2024-03-14 15:45:31,0.13859416445623343,0.4584438549955791,0.036,0.131,0.9897

The whole bitcoin will be/is a currency is getting annoying.,"My parents talked to their financial advisor about bitcoin as I told them i was invested. They said he told them bitcoin will never be a currency and the government would never allow it to be a currency because they would have no control over it.

He compared it to the Canadian cannabis bubble and pretty much declared it a fad that will crash when all the ""big players"" cash out. Told them I shouod sell and invest in stocks like enbridge.

Nothing like a little FUD from the parents. 

I get the excitement about thinking of bitcoin being a currency in the far future, but  it sounds crazy to people when they hear it. Or Maybe I'm missing the point, and only seeing half the picture.

Does this make MSTR a better investment in terms of being able to manage downside risk?,Bitcoin,https://reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1bery8t/will_mstr_sell_bitcoin_in_a_bear_market_or_hold/,2024-03-14 14:18:24,0.2438271604938272,0.48487654320987655,0.084,0.067,0.0
Bitcoin = Savings Tech,"I just watched a video interview with Mark Yusko. He calls Bitcoin a Savings Technology. I've already been convinced about BTC, but this term really clicked for me. Imagine when this clicks for the entire world!

Yusko also wants people to start thinking in Satoshis, which many of us here already do. I hadn't calculated my Sats before, but I'm happy to say I'm a Satoshi Multi-Millionaire!",Bitcoin,https://reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1beruo0/bitcoin_savings_tech/,2024-03-14 14:14:14,0.38,0.485,0.0,0.106,0.8168
What's this video?,"Back in like 2015-17, there was this vid about some guy being interviewed about bitcoin. And he tells a story about how the us government bombs and kills civilians and they justify it. He then gets super emotional and angry at that story and says that bitcoin takes that power away from them.

For the life of me, I can't remember who it was or what to search to find it. I thought it was Andreas, but can't seem to find it anymore.

Does anyone have any idea what I'm referring to? ",Bitcoin,https://reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1berniw/whats_this_video/,2024-03-14 14:05:56,-0.04166666666666667,0.5791666666666666,0.045,0.06,0.1179
