Will DJT shit the bed next week? Full DD with updated regard speculative theory on Trump selling,"Before this adderall-fueled hype train leaves the station next week, I thought i'd write up a definitive DD on the imminent DWAC/DJT merger.

This DD will cover everything: fundamentals, Truth Social, ownership, dilution, Trump's holdings and lockup, the future of TMTG, regarded theories and more. You may have seen my [original comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bkvr48/comment/kw10fel/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) (that was stolen and reposted) with a regarded theory about Trump selling shares - **if you can't be bothered to read the full DD, then skip to the end for an updated regard theory of Trump potentially selling shares - now with new information and speculation!**

Before I begin, a quick shoutout to the legend that is u/SPAC_Time. This guy is probably the most knowledgeable person about SPACs i've ever seen, and has been posting excellent information over on r/DWAC_Uncensored, a lot of which is included in this DD. I strongly recommend going and having a look at this sub as it has SO much great information on it. There's loads on there that i've not included in this DD. He's also patiently answered all my questions, so thank you king.

I've been following this since the beginning, and even made an account on Truth Social to see what the bulls are thinking. Honestly some of the shit they come out with over there make the regards on this sub seem like fucking Albert Einstein.

I'll also preface this by saying I have a terrible trading record, mostly crippling losses, so obviously none of this is financial advice and you should ignore everything I say. If anything is incorrect drop a comment below and i'll fix it.

# Overview

You probably already know what this is about, so I won't go into to much detail. Back in 2021, Trump started his own company, TMTG (Trump Media and Technology Group), which owns the social media network Truth Social. It wasn't actually Trump's idea, it was pitched to him, more on this later. The aim is to bring this to the public markets via a SPAC merger with DWAC (Digital World Acquisition Corp). Yesterday shareholders approved the merger, and it's set to complete this merge next week. DWAC has been trading publicly for a few years now, soon the ticker will change to DJT when the merger is finalised.

Before I get into the finer details, here's a quick TL;DR of the bull and bear points for those who will look at this post and say ""i'm not reading all that""

# Bullish

* Trump is a hype machine.
* Something something woke mind virus and free speech
* Truth Social is a soapbox for Trump, and everyone listens to what he says.
* The run-up to the election will generate a lot of hype.
* If Trump wins the election, DJT could trade on hype for a long time
* In theory, if he does win the election, TMTG could become significantly more relevant, leading to an improvement in its fundamentals.
* If the above happens, it's possible TMTG could bring to market their other proposed ventures - a news network and competitor to the existing streaming services.

# Bearish

* The fundamentals are pure dogshit
* If Trump loses the election, it's all over, TMTG will probably go bankrupt.
* Trump could potentially sell shares around the time of the merger.
* DJT will be propped up by just hype, not adequate shareholder equity, which is volatile and unstable.
* The dilution could cause a significant drop in share price if there isn't enough hype to offset it.
* Trump is a serial grifter who's failed at many businesses in the past and screwed over countless customers, investors, suppliers and more.
* SPACs have had a terrible track record in recent years, espeically those with poor fundamantals.
* SPACs are a cheap way to go to market, with the shareholders bearing the cost of this.
* TMTG has no path to profitability in the forseable future. It has not provided any updated business plans, future growth estimates, guidance or updated revenue projections.
* The other proposed ventures (news network, streaming service) are extremely expensive to get going, we're talking hundreds of millions, even billions of dollars just to get off the ground. As i'll explain later, TMTG *could* have gained the cash to do this through the merger, but unwound it, making these ventures completely unfeasible with the cash DJT will get in this merger.

Right lets get into the details.

# Truth Social

Currently, Truth Social is the only revenue stream that TMTG has. I don't know if you've been on there at all but it's basically a hive-mind echo chamber of Trump worship.

There's basically 3 types of users:

* MAGA cult
* Bots shilling ED pills and fake gold coins.
* A small number of anti-Trump trolls, posting on every truth Trump does.

I am of the opinion that Truth Social is a completely flawed concept. The concept is that Trump is trying to make a social media network, or ""big tent"", that will be a town-square that is used by everyone - Republicans, Democrats, independents, everyone.

In reality, Truth Social is a social media network hashed together from open source code to spread one-sided propaganda of a presidential candidate. Right off the bat it's a one-sided Trumpfest, and does not make any effort to include anyone other than MAGA.

If Hillary Clinton made a social media network, do you think MAGA would join it? They absolutely wouldn't and this question just highlights their flawed thinking.

You can say what you want about the one-sided nature that the legacy social media networks like Twitter became, but they weren't set up by a political candidate solely to give them a soapbox.

There's also nearly no unique IP behind Truth Social. It's an open-source platform with no unique features. Other than (currently) the only way to hear Trump's thoughts as he takes a shit, it's worthless. It doesn't even live up to it's ""free speech"" claims, as they regularly ban people for arbitrary reasons.

# Fundamentals

Unsurprisingly, the fundamentals of this company are absolute dogshit. This company makes barely any revenue, and has losses in the tens of millions. I can't see how this is going to get any better after merger, and they'll have an $18m SEC fine to pay.

From the balance sheet from the latest revision of the S4 in February:

For the 9 months ended September 30 2023, TMTG made about $3.2m, with an operating loss on that is about $10m.

TMTG claimed that in it's current financial year it projects to make about $17m in revenue, although I can't see how this projection wold be accurate. There's not been any meaningful uptick in users on Truth Social, major advertisers still avoid advertising there, and the other alleged revenue streams that they proposed early on (like a news network and streaming competitor) haven't come to fruition.

# There's barely any cash backing shares of DJT

The shareholder equity of DJT after the merger will be painfully low. After the merger completes, DJT will have access to the money in the trust. This money is essentially the money that DWAC sold the original DWAC shares for when it initially entered the market before it found an acquisition target (TMTG) - about 30m shares at $10/share - so the trust has approximately $300 million in it.

After the merger, DJT will have to pay an $18m fine to the SEC as a result of the investigation which concluded last year.

Ignore the current market value of DWAC shares for a moment. Let's look at how much cash is actually backing each share. Doing a rudimentary calculation (because we don't know exactly how much money DJT will actually get from the trust, or the in-depth liabilities TMTG has): Lets say we take the full value of the $300m trust, minus the SEC fine, and the actual cash backing each share of DJT will be approximately $2.08 per share. This value could be even lower, as legal fees and other operational expenses (like DWAC expenses, and potentially costs of their lawsuits) need to be subtracted from the trust on merger before the cash is released to DJT.

This low cash backing for each share is very low, it's even very low for a SPAC. In the last four years, the average cash backing per share after merge of all SPACs was about $6.67.

Normally, SPACs obtain PIPE (Private Equity in Public Entity) investment during the merger process to offset low cash per share after merge. They specifically do this to ensure the SPAC can meet its operational obligations, and pay all the required costs to bring the merger to market.

DWAC did have a $1.3b PIPE deal set up. This would have given the company an absolute shit ton of money, enough to fund operations for years, and fuel expansion and growth. It would have meant that each share of DJT would have been worth approximately $11.80 - pretty solid cash backing for a SPAC.

However, they completely unwound this PIPE investment. My guess is because they didn't want the extreme dilution that the PIPE would have caused. The PIPE shares were not under lockup, and PIPE investors could have sold immediately on market open after the merger, destroying the share price. They were given a good deal on the shares (it was a percentage below current market value), so likely would have sold for an immediate profit. Remember this part because it works into my regarded theory later on. Spoiler alert: They weren't protecting the retail shareholders by doing this.

# Ownership and dilution - what about the 1 billion shares?

Currently, DWAC is mostly owned by retail. These retail shareholders are somewhat unlike ""normal"" retail shareholders in that they are insanely dedicated. Many of the estimated 400,000 retail shareholders in this will not sell for any reason. Trump could literally dump shit in their faces and they'd probably take it and hold their shares. You could say that this retail holding is stronger than in the average company

After the merger this will all change.

Currently the float of DWAC is about 30m shares.

After the merger, the DJT float will swell to about 135m shares. The majority of these shares will be owned by Trump, currently under lockup for 6 months (more on this later).

There's been lots of talk about 1 billion shares being dumped into the float after merger. This has even been widely circulated in the press, but it's incorrect.

DWAC have authorised 1 billion shares, it hasn't issued them. This means that in the future, DJT could potentially issue up to 1 billion more shares without having to conduct a shareholder vote or amend the company charter. It's like 1 billion reserve shares sat there if they need it.

It's actually a pretty common thing to do with IPOs and SPACs, many companies authorise shares to be issued later on to raise funds etc.

In any case, if they did issue more shares from this 1 billion amount, it wouldn't be until way after the merger.

There will, however, be significant dilution on merge. On business completion, up to 8,369,509 shares will be dumped into the float, given to holders of TMTG convertible notes. These shares will not be locked up like other insider shares, and can be sold immediately after merge. The holders of these notes will likely do this because they'll immediately realise a 400%+ gain. This is significant dilution, and could cause a huge drop in share price, unless insane Trump mania causes a hype rally to offset it. Much of the rest of the float is potentially (foreshadowing here) locked up, but this 8m share dump is significant.

# Trump hype

The hype surrounding trump is real. We've seen it many times before with DWAC - the insane rally to $175/share was surreal. It's plummet after was equally unreal.

The hype has the potential to offset everything - shitty fundamentals, insane dilution and more. It's the reason DWAC has traded so far away from reality in terms of an accurate valuation.

I'm sure you all saw this post about the hype, that led to you all pumping up the price of the OP's contracts by like 800% before he sold most of them:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bikpfj/these\_calls\_could\_be\_500\_baggers\_turn\_1000\_into/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bikpfj/these_calls_could_be_500_baggers_turn_1000_into/)

The first takeaway from the above DD is that the hype is fucking insane, and supersedes everything, can cause the share price to rocket to the moon regardless of anything else.

I agree with this. It's possible that there will be a huge buying demand to offset the dilution on merge. DJT could rally to the fucking moon.

The other is the theory that Trump will shill DJT and all his MAGA cult will all rush to buy in.

This theory i'm not convinced on. Much of his cult have no idea how to trade shares, many of them are braindead and can barely read. And if you think that they'd buy shares anyway, think about this:

Trump has literally been on-stage at rallies in front of tens of thousands of his most die-hard supporters, and directly shilled Truth Social to them and they *still* haven't rushed to join. And Truth Social is a zero-barrier, free to use social media network specifically set up for them.

I personally don't think we'll see millions of MAGA pouring into the market to buy DJT. Any MAGA who already know how to trade will be holding shares of DWAC already.

# Regarded Trump selling theory - now with updates!

Now it's time for the juicy stuff - the regarded speculative theory on Trump selling shares.

Disclaimer: This is a regarded theory that probably won't happen, obviously i'm jumping to conclusions not necessarily found in hard evidence. If it does happen, though, I expect to be awarded a flair from the mods.

It's widely understood that Trump has a lockup on his shares for six months after the merger.

There is, however, a clause that undermines this.

In the [latest revision of the S4](https://app.quotemedia.com/data/downloadFiling?webmasterId=90423&ref=318071075&type=HTML&symbol=DWAC&cdn=7df8a564ed5159633ce6abd5829662e5&companyName=Digital+World+Acquisition+Corp.&formType=S-4%2FA&formDescription=%5BAmend%5D+Registration+of+securities%2C+business+combinations&dateFiled=2024-02-14), filed in February, on page 42, it reads:

>Lock-Up. **Unless waived by Digital World prior to the Closing**, key stockholders of TMTG (including its management team) agreed to be subject to a six-month lockup in respect of their Digital World common stock, subject to certain customary exceptions, which would provide important stability to the leadership and governance of TMTG.

This means that, at any time before the merger closes, DWAC could waive Trump's lockup for some or all of his shares. Further to this, they could do it before it was disclosed publicly. In addition to this, Trump could sell shares for several days before DJT issued it's first 8K approximately 4 days after the merger.

As mentioned in my previous comments, I theorise that Trump could potentially dump some or maybe even all of his shares, potentially even destroying the company and allowing him to walk away with billions. He could then just go back to X to continue to be able to reach an audience far bigger than on TS.

Remember when Trump met with Elon earlier this month, and everyone thought it was to do with Elon donating to Trump's campaign? Wrong. I theorise that they were doing a mutually-beneficial deal:

Elon agrees to ensure Trump never gets banned from X under any circumstances, ensuring he always has a soapbox.

Trump agrees to return to X, giving Elon a huge bump in viewers.

Trump dumps a load of his shares, pays his legal bills, makes a shit ton of money, gets a much bigger audience on X compared to Truth Social. It's a win win for both of them.

**Additionally, I theorise that DWAC unwound the PIPE deal not for retail shareholder benefit, but to avoid Trump's shares from dropping in value so he could sell them at a higher price after merge. DWAC never issued a reason publicly as to why they unwound the PIPE. Unwinding the PIPE is seriously detrimental to the core of the business itself. It means significantly less cash to fund operations for a company that makes yearly losses in the tens of millions with no path to profitability.**

The company will get under $300m of cash, rather than nearly $1.6bn it would have gotten with the PIPE deal + initial $300m share offering by DWAC. I'm yet to hear a reasonable explination as to why DWAC would unwind the PIPE.

The counters to the above tin-foil hat theory are:

""But Trump wouldn't need to sell, he could just borrow against his shares""

I'm not convinced about this for several reasons. Firstly, what sane lender is going to lend up shares that are under lockup for 6 months. They wouldn't be able to force Trump to sell his shares to repay the debt for up to 6 months if he defaulted on the loan. Secondly, TMTG is basically worthless, with barely any shareholder equity as described above...his shares aren't worth anything and have barely any cash backing them. Lenders will want solid fundamentals before lending against shares, they aren't gonna lend him half a billion $ on shares that are propped up on hype.

[Reuters is also reporting](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/investors-greenlight-trumps-6-billion-social-media-deal-2024-03-22/) that he can't borrow against them due to previous terms he's agreed to:

>It is unclear how and when these cases will be resolved. Even if the  deal gets completed next week, Trump will not be allowed to sell any of  his shares in the combined company for six months **or borrow against them**, based on terms he previously agreed.

""The board wouldn't allow it""

Go look at who the board of DJT is made up of: Trump, his sons and some of his closest yes-men. He basically controls the board. The DWAC board is made up of Trump yes-men as well. The fucking SEC investigation was specifically about how Trump colluded with DWAC without disclosing it publicly.

""Why would Trump destroy his own company?""

Because said company is basically worthless. It has a high share price now based on hype, but it's going to take A LOT of work to get it generating revenue and profit. When the hype dies down, the share price could plummet, reducing hes unrealised net worth. If he loses the election it's all over, and if he hasn't sold by that point he'd lose BILLIONS. Institutional investors won't be touching this, so there won't be a solid foundation of ownership.

Trump looks out for himself, and he's backed into a corner.

""But he's screwing over his base""

Obviously there's a risk here, in that dumping his shares on his cult could cause a significant backlash, and he needs every vote he can get going into an election. However current DWAC shareholders are a tiny percentage of his base. If he dumped his shares on them, the majority of his base probably wouldn't even know about it. I'm not even convinced they'd turn on him either, they are literally in a cult. Remember when he said this back in 2016: ""I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn't lose any voters, OK?"". Still rings true today.

Trump is desperate. NY is about to start seizing his assets, potentially within days. I can't imagine him choosing TMTG over Trump Tower for example, especially when he could potentially liquidate his entire holding of TMTG for an immediate gain of several billion cash.

# What's going to happen after merger?

Honestly...who fucking knows. It could absolutely shit the bed due to dilution even if Trump doesn't sell shares.

Or the hype of Trump could propel the share price into the stratosphere.

EDIT: Forgot to add in the next step which will be the ticker changing from DWAC to DJT. The earliest this could happen is Monday. However an actual date hasn't been announced yet, so it could be Tuesday or Wednesday, or even later towards the end of the week.

I could, and probably will be, wrong about all of this. Be sensible and don't trade this merger.

Have fun regards.

CR-AAPL is a BUY. The AI bull market is only beginning.,"Fiends and family across the globe,

Last week I was beginning to believe we were about to enter a correction. I was mistaken. The markets are instead primed for an ""erection"".

Why? Well, for one I've been watching AAPL quite closely recently. The shadow puppeteers of the market threw out some headlines to pump and dump it this week. AAPL trying to get some AI on their phones with partnerships from Google and chinese companies. AAPL getting sued by Biden admin cuz Trump says he likes to suck off Tim Cook on his CNBC interview. Do these headlines truly affect price though? I doubt it. If there was such concern, their market makers wouldn't have taken the risk to stick AAPL to 172.5 (strike price) over the weekend.

If you follow AAPL closely, you'll notice these guys actually have so much control over their own stock price they regularly burn both sides on earnings. Opex almost always settles at max pain. Not only do they control their stock price, they control the Chinese and American governments. Their stock is a little bit down, but it hasn't diminished their power nor influence. They're still one of the biggest indirect employers in China via their supply lines. In the US they have mind control over about half the population of adult voters and are one of the largest sources of tax revenue.

SO WHY THE FUCK IS AAPL's STOCK DOWN RELATIVE TO THE MARKET!? It's simple. There needs to be an area of intense consolidation for investors to really dial into pushing price higher. Nobody wants to load AAPL at 200 to push for their next step at like 220-230. They want it at 170. That's a much better risk proposition.

NVDA is leading the way and will probably top out at like 5000 or something. Yup, a 13 trillion dollar valuation. The thing is the market just has no chill when it comes to understanding this next wave of economic gains is going to replace most of the workforce by 2030 and businesses won't have to deal with payroll anymore, just taxes. It's gonna be a world just like the Hunger Games, but with a twist of Terminator.

Soundhound,"I am fully invested at 8.11 cost basis with a total of 13000 shares.  Not worried by any means. If you play the stock market you always know that there are going to be ups and downs.  

Companies such as Soun that start to gain momentum especially this early in the ai boom will always lose traction due to short sellers that lose large amounts of money when things aren’t going their way. 

This is why last week short selling bombarded the news so that the bears could make back the money they lost.  It’s a push and pull sort of thing.  On top of making their money back they are pushing the stock to its lowest point to then hop on the train as it starts to go back up to make even more money. 

Reports of the ceo and coo selling shares was made to satisfy tax withholding obligations related to the vesting of restricted stock units. Of course they don’t mention this when they put out these reports because this helps them short the stock even more. 

If you’re a day trader trying to make money obviously this may have threw you for a loop and the panic selling began.

Next NVDA Move,"What’s going on regards — I come bearing some gain porn disguised in an inquiry for regarded and sensible opinions alike. 

Now these have clearly printed more than enough so I’m looking to mitigate risk a bit. In particular, I don’t trust the next couple FOMCs and inflation numbers action. I have no doubts they’ll crush earnings, but we just saw a semi-“delayed” pump with NVDA after the keynote.

APPLE AI/TECH GAME PLAN ,"Hi, I want to know what you guys think about this idea on Apple. Let me know. 

Apple has become one of the most successful companies of all time. They were the innovators of the past but and not really pushing the boundaries like NVDIA. This is a good thing for Apple and what I believe to be their plan. 

1. Monopoly’s run shit in America. companies that have established themselves as economic powerhouses continue to take over and consume industries. It’s possible that Apple could be waiting to buy their way into the AI/TECH boom instead of trying to innovate further. 

2. APPLE has a massive cash pile and it’s been  growing just as soon as the AI/TECH boom started. This allows Apple to have options when it comes to their next move in the industry.

3. Growing cash pile isn’t good for now. From what I’ve see a growing cash pile means the stock for Apple has underperformed. But as soon as we see Apple start to put that money to use which we have not seen yet it just allows investors stock up on shares. 

4. Apple could simply buy their way into the industry and become a top dog again because they have enough money and resources to either buy a company that already has experience with the new age of tech. Or Apple could start to dump money into something new and impactful since they already have more than enough capital and resources to pull it off.

What’s my plan?
I plan on waiting for that cash pile to keep stacking high and as soon as I see significant decreases I will dump money into shares and wait a year or buy leaps.

DWAC is dropping to $2.5 after the merger and here’s why (your calls are fucked),"dd pulled from chester-ming s comment

Positions:
700 2.5p April 19, 2024

After the merger this is going to shit the bed.
Trump is gonna dump some of his shares. ""But what about his lockup??"" you say. Allow me to explain, it's tin-foil hat time:

DWAC could waive his lockup at the last minute (they can do this, it's noted in SEC filings), and he'll dump shares on the open market for cash so he can pay for his legal woes. It's possible that he could have two days to sell shares before he even has to disclose his sells publicly. DWAC may be able to waive the lockup at the 11th hour before even notifying shareholders.
Remember that meeting earlier in the month with Elon and Trump shrouded in secrecy - everyone thought it was a meeting about Elon giving Trump money for his campaign? Wrong. I theorise that they were doing a mutually-beneficial deal:

Elon agrees to ensure Trump never gets banned from X under any circumastances, ensuring he always has a soapbox.

Trump agrees to return to X, giving Elon a huge bump in viewers, potentially saving X from ruin.
Trump dumps his shares, pays his legal bills, makes a shit ton of money, gets a much bigger audience on X compared to Truth Social. It's a win win for both of them.

Trump doesn't like tricky businesses that are difficult to run and make money from, he likes simple grifts. Social media takes a lot of time, effort and money to make a profit from, especially these days (see Reddit not making profit ever, or Twitter burning through cash for years). He didn't really set up TS as a proper business, he just wanted to create something so people could hear what he says since he was banned from Twitter at the time. He's been unbanned now tho, and Elon runs it, and that's where the audience will be for him in the run up to the election.

Trump will want a quick exit and the merger is a perfect opportunity for him to do so. He's also desperate now since NY is about to start sizeing his assets - Trump Tower or Truth Social? Not gonna be a difficult decision for him.

After this the share price will absolutely tank and the company will collapse into bankrupcy.
Oh and IV on options is going to shit the bed on Friday. Also DWAC could very possibly not get enough votes and adjourn the meeting, it's happened many times before. Again call options will get destroyed if this happens.

Don't trade on the info in this comment i'm probably wrong, and i'm usually wrong. But maybe i'm right this time...who knows.

TLDR:
Trump need money. Trump have legal loophole. Trump sell shares. Good time to buy far otm puts before Monday. DWAC fucked.

What the actual heck happened with LULU,"We are in a market where a company like LULU that increased profits 400% YoY dumps -20% because it didn't outperform its massive outperformance. We're pricing everything like its Nvidia, so when a company merely does great (comparatively) and isn't 3x'ing every quarter the speculation deflates so quickly ON POSITIVE EARNINGS. When we are at the point where stock prices reflect speculation on exponential future growth, any indication of slow down IN GROWTH collapses a stock, thats how you know we are in a bubble. With an astronomical P/E in the 60's before today, 16% Sales Growth YoY isn't enough in this market. I think LULU is just a demonstration of what could happen to many other tickers that are pricing in decades of double digits growth when a company magically can't maintain that rate of growth.

$DWAC rug pool,"By now most of you have heard of $DWAC and know today's news about the merger vote, most of you also know the Daddy Trump has a small fine due on Monday.

For those less informed, let's break it down:

$DWAC is a SPAC (special purpose acquisition company) that is set to have a meeting today to merge with Truth Social (Trumps social media site) to effectively list Truth Social on the NYSE.

If this vote goes through Trump will be the owner of 58% of Truth Social. Also if the Merger goes through the combined value of DWAC and Truth Social will be around $5b in market cap, effectively giving Trump around a $3b asset.

Let's take a look at that $5b valuation, Truth Social had a revenue stream of $3.38m for the first 9 months of 2023 and a net operating loss of $49m over the same time period. Furthermore, the revenue decreased as the months went by as the operating loss increased as the months went by. According to their regulatory filing they ""expect to incur significant losses into the foreseeable future"".

From an economic standpoint from experts ""Given their sales...It's hard to believe that the long-term economic value of this company could be as high as $100m...so talking about billions is absolutely ridiculous.""

Let's dive deeper and look at their user base. Truth Social has around 5 million active users as of Feb 2024, this is compared to over 2 billion users on TikTok and 3 billion users on Facebook. Furthermore app download numbers show that a majority of the user accounts have been around for years, with monthly user growth less than 10% of what it was in 2022.

Okay, so the company is looking over-valued and doesn't show signs of great growth, what does the settlement have to do with it?

Back in February Trump was ruled against in a civil fraud case and ordered to pay $355m + interest. That bill has now increased to $465m and is due on Monday 3/25.

On top of this Trump has been denied his stay from this payment in the now famous quote ""you have failed to explain, much less justify any basis for a stay."". So Trump has since done the reasonable thing and tried to secure a bond to cover the fine. This hasn't gone great as he was reportedly denied by over 30 banks for a bond to cover the settlement. This means a few things:

1. The banks that get special access to his assets to decide if they want to issue the bond, have determined the risk of him not paying the bond is not worth the collateral assets he offered.

2. The banks believe that there is little chance he will win an appeal of this settlement.

3. He's pissed off a lot of banks, probably because of the aforementioned fraud.

Ultimately this means that Trump will have no recourse but to pay the settlement on Monday or the asset-seizure process will begin.

So what are his options? Well he's got a $3b asset that is about to land in his lap, that is a pretty big option, however, there are hurdles.

First off, the merger has to get approved at today's meeting, that will officially list Truth Social on the NYSE. That's hurdle one.

The problem then becomes that Trump would have a 6 month holding period where he can't sell his stock. That is, unless by another vote they offer an exemption to this rule. If the exemption is issued, Trump will have the right to sell his holdings at the bell on Monday, the same Monday he has a $465m fine due and has shown he doesn't have the liquid assets to cover. That's hurdle two.

If this happens, he could sell near 30% of his holdings, which would equate to about 19% of the total Truth Social market cap or around $1b to cover his settlement. This will send the stock into absolute free fall come Monday.

If this process were to play out this way, it would be the all to common reverse-robinhood. Taking money from the poor, to fund the riches settlements for having shady business practices.

Is this a fact in stone? No, there are hurdles of course. However, given the ridiculous over-valuation of this company, the lack of growth and user base and the potential for a whale dump, all I'm saying is tread lightly my friends.",wallstreetbets,https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bkzy79/dwac_rug_pool/,2024-03-22 10:01:00,0.08107539682539684,0.45093990929705213,0.059,0.125,0.9908
I've seen some terrible SPAC deals in the past 3 years but DWAC is another level of hell,"I've followed the SPAC market in the last 3 years and almost been involved in a de-SPAC myself before raising $175m in a private round.

Often the de-SPAC merger slide decks are full of caveats to get the bankers off the hook, with tiny footnotes that absolve the intermediaries of any blame. 

But the DWAC deck is off the charts. The estimates of TMTG revenues and users are literally question marks, like literally the symbol ""?"". Seriously, see page 10:-

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1849635/000119312521348593/d242442dex992.htm

The revenue numbers are underpinned by silly assumptions on the last pair of slides and show literally $0 from subscriptions in the actuals for 2021. Literally zero. 

And yet there are statements like ""Could TMTG+ reach 10m subscribers and contribute to a highly valuable enterprise?"" (p.35). Well, could it, starting from zero? 

I've never seen anything more likely to lose investors all their money and hand a big stack of cash to the sponsors and possibly Trump if he can wangle himself out of the 6 month lock-up. If the SPAC doesn't see very high redemptions prior to trading it would be amazing.

Absolute long-dated put below the money today if you want to get rich. SPACs are mostly garbage, but this one is off the charts bad. Kerrisdale did a really good takedown a while back:

# Why would he have tweeted about it or pushed it until it becomes ""his stock""? It would have been stupid. Believe me, the average MAGA member is not thinking:

""Hmmm well the merger meeting of the SPAC $DWAC was today and I see that the lockup period is XYZ""

Why SMTC is dropping after earnings,"Hello regards,

First I’d like to point out as of now I’m the only one who thinks SMTC is going to drop (check earnings discussion). 

I’ve been looking into previous earnings. July 2023 (Sept 13th) before earnings we were at the exact same price as we are now. That day saw an increase of around 8%. It’s very important to highlight that, for that Quarter EPS was beat by over 400% and accumulated a revenue of 236M dollars (still being net negative btw). 

This Quarter, SMTC is supposed to have 190M in revenue which is significantly worse, and is only 40M higher than Jan 2023 Quarter where we saw the stock plummet. IMO for the stock to rocket after earnings EPS has to be significantly beat even more than the 400% July was able to achieve. Even then, the stock only jumped 8% and with earnings being a projected 45M less I don’t see how this stock goes up.

This is not financial advice

NKE went double down TWICE. First in December when they posted weak guidance. Then again just yesterday. They beat earnings estimates both times. They're down about 23% since their December earnings call. Again, despite beating earnings on both quarters.

FL fell off a cliff, down 30% since their earnings (also weak guidance, but they also fucked up earnings).

LULU RIP on weak guidance (down 16% since their call yesterday).

Consumer confidence was high at the holiday season, but it's come back down to reality. January consumer spending shocked to the downside. February consumer spending was lower than expectations.

Consumer confidence is fucked. People are sobering up to the reality that inflation is here to stay, even if JPow does a wink-wink, 3 rate cuts this year. If March CPI is fucked, that goes out the window too.

Now, let's look at RL. Surely, it should be down given all of these macro concerns for consumer discretionary, the american consumer (as evidenced by LULU guidance with softening NA sales).

NOPE. about 2% off the all time high (192) sitting at $197.60 (and that's after a 1.5% down day).

This is the MF'ing chart. It's up 28.47% YTD. It's trading like a tech AI stock. But it ain't.

Notice that cliff at $170 to $140. If it falls, especially on bad earnings & guidance, it'll fall through that floor.

Earnings is anticipated some time between May 21st and May 24th. Unfortunately the options for this ticker are monthly and quarterly (not weekly), so the May monthly options will be just short of the earnings date. I've got puts for June at $150.

[Ignore the P\/L unrealized losses. I opened these today, at basically the stock's ATH.

Thoughts on $MTCH (online dating)?,"It appears to have bottomed.

Hedge funds have gotten in recently.

Their cash flow looks good.

And just from a common sense perspective and a personal perspective I personally was a previous paid member because not only am I not a big bar or club guy but I think people are tired of spending hundreds of dollars on a night out to barely meet anyone that's half decent. For 20 bucks a month I can sit on my couch and filter through the good and the bad much easier. 

One thing that concerns me is I don't foresee there being any kind of catalysts to really move it quickly so it could just be a slow steady climb.

The insane $TSLA bull case no analyst sees coming yet,"BUCKLE UP MFKERS, I GOT THE SCOOP FOR THE NEXT MOONING (AS BIG AS AI WAS)

**TLDR (cuz who here can actually read):** Idgaf about TSLA as a car company, soon noone else will too. Due to China and nerds making insane tech, humanoid robotics will be HUGE by late 2024. TSLA the company that will win this race. Market will realize in a cuppa months. Market for this is 20-100T USD with infinite growth potential. TSLA is quietly becoming the NVIDIA of humanoid robotics.

AI hype has hit the street, you know what that calls for: it's time to pivot to what the old f\*cks on the street is blind to (cuz they're so old).

Humanoid robotics. Any hedge fund manager would laugh, that's why it's genius.

1. Robotics has been around for a long time, but try programming a robot the same way you program a computer and ofc it will fail. It can't reason the way we reason. Since AI popped off, robotics has been reaping the rewards. While yall sleeping, terminator is being built. Check rate of progress from 2022 -> 2024, it's insane and show no signs of slowing.
   1. This is not the boring toyota drunk robots that can't do sh\*t. This is solid progress made at supersonic speeds on making robot workers for real. There is no limits to this actually working, it's an engineering problem at this point and a matter of time.
2. Ofc Xi Jing Ping is sharper than any of the dementia patients sitting in congress. China makes savvy decisions and guess what their plan is: **500 humanoid robot workers / 10 000 ppl by 2025. That is** **3.8 million humanoid robots.** They have put their money where their mouth is and gone b a l l s deep on investment into this. They are showing good results and making insane progress quickly.
   1. The implications here alone are huge: China US rivalry won't die anytime soon. This will force the hand of the US. A trump win would be huge as he can see stuff like this coming. He just needs to talk about it to legitimize the industry, and he surely will.
3. The market for humanoid robots is as big as the market for manual labour as long as the bots can perform the tasks efficiently. Analysts forecasts don't count towards the trajectory we are on. IE THE MARKET IS CURRENTLY 30% OF WORLD GDP WITH NEAR INFINITE GROWTH POTENTIAL.

Here is why TSLA will be a huge winner in this.

* Name of the game in AI is training data, talent and compute. Tesla has huge training data advantage as their vision models already are extremely good.
   * They have already chugged away at this problem for years and years as the chip needs to be inside the robot, and not in some huge gpu datacenter. Guess what they have in their cars: A lightweight, energy efficient chip for exactly this type of processing.
   * They have the human talent and is well regarded in the AI industry. Altough Grok so far has sucked, Elon realizes that it's immensily important to get this model smarter and is putting heavy focus on that. This is directly to augment their tesla bots with reasoning capabilities. Grok is specifically designed to solve reasoning unlike other AI models where the focus is more towards workplace efficiency.
   * They already have a multimodal model with language understanding inside their bots.
   * We should see actually useful humanoid bots working in their factory this year. They will 100% use them internally a lot before selling anything. After proper field tests and refinement the market will be GASPING for these bots. They don't even need to be anywhere as close to good as perfect, they just need to be as good as 70iq darren in minnesota doing the same repetitive task over and over again. We already have that intelligence in language models today.
* Lack of AI day: To quote deranged Elon: *"" Some of our competitors look at what we do on a frame by frame basis. The same happened with Battery Day. So we have to be a little cautious, but some kind of update would be good to do. Will discuss with the team, maybe something later this year. Our main goal with these AI Day things is recruiting and to change the perception of Tesla as a car company.""*
   * Essentially, AI day has not happened bcause they don't want to give up their competitive edge, not because of lack of progress. Once Investors realize TSLA are capable as an AI company, market will reflect that.
* Manufacturing. Idc if figure01 from figureAI is good as balls, they have ZERO experience in manufacturing. Manufacturing these bots will be the hard problem to solve. There is no better company set up for this than TSLA. (MSFT is bull case long term too btw)
   * TSLA CAN TEST THESE BOTS LIVE IN THEIR OWN FACTORIES WHILE DEVELOPING, THE ADVANTAGE IS ENOURMOUS. Having integrated development for exactly the type of customers they would sell to once it's mature.
   * TSLA has walked the road of going from startup to one of the leading EV manufacturers. They continually develop their manufacturing processes, taking insane risks to make it more efficient. THERE IS NO OTHER COMPANY BETTER SET UP TO GET MASS PRODUCTION OF THESE BOTS GOING ONCE THEY'VE REACHED A VIABLE PRODUCT
* Chinese competition: China might very well beat tsla to the punch in this, this is good. Why? Because US would NEVER rely on china to make them their robots. They will turn this into a case of national security faster than i can inseminate my 5'2 mewtoo build gf.

And I haven't even gotten to the best part yet: it doesn't matter if these robots can take over the world or not, ALL THAT MATTERS IS THAT INVESTORS AT SOME POINT THINK THEY CAN. Riding the hype 'bubble' is irrelevant, only thing that matters is being ahead of the bubble.

As engineer, I see no reason that this will be a bubble, just a matter of time. What will be tricky is getting manufacturing up to scale, but from a moon case scenario - that doesn't fkn matter. All that matters is a belief that it will happen and tsla stock price will reflect it. There is NO DOUBT that they are the US company best set up to do this.

**MY POSITION:** Call options for TSLA 350 by dec 2025. (retrad bookie won't let me go higher)

**MY PREDICTION:** TSLA anywhere from 400 - Nvidia levels of valuation (750+) by late 2025. Short term we prolly won't see any gains on tsla due to this development hasn't gotten any hype yet but sometime this late summer / fall (Elon time accounted) we should see the hype about this getting started for real.

Lost $25K in a single day - 2021 meme stock roller-coaster revisited," Hey fellow degenerates,

Let me take you back to a simpler time, Dec 2020 - Jan 2021, when I, a bright-eyed and bushy-tailed newbie, decided to dive headfirst into the murky waters of options trading. Armed with nothing but the Robinhood app and dreams of Lambos, I embarked on what can only be described as a financial roller-coaster.

In the span of a little over a month, I managed to execute 36 trades. My instruments of choice? Calls on LUCID, ""stock-that-shall-not-be-named"", and PMC. Yes, I was riding the meme stock wave, hoping to surf my way to untold riches. Spoiler alert: it didn't go as planned.

Here's the breakdown:

* Total Gains: $30,000
* Total Losses: $50,000

As you can see below, I had a win rate of about 50%. Not too shabby for a rookie, right? Wrong. Because amidst these battles, there was one day, January 25th, that will forever be etched in my memory. 

**On that fateful day, I managed to lose $25,000 in a matter of minutes, as the short squeeze came to an abrupt end when Robinhood decided to halt options trading.** This was equivalent of my 6 months pay at that time. And poof, just like that, it was gone! 

**I literally had a GUH moment and I remember my hands trembling in disbelief that I was down $25,000 in less than 2 minutes . I don't play poker or gamble otherwise, so this shock was particularly severe and I did what any rational person would do - I deleted the Robinhood app** and tried to erase the entire episode from my mind!

https://preview.redd.it/uur971t0mxpc1.png?width=455&format=png&auto=webp&s=311803a1920eb8d4a5068d7ca2dee734f5ec90bb

For three long years, I avoided confronting the reality of what happened. But today, I mustered the courage to look back at my Robinhood history and reconcile with my past.

Why am I sharing this story on here, you ask? Because it's cathartic and today was the first day I'm seeing all these trades after 3 years of being away from robinhood. Now that I look back, I think had I not lost $25,000 on that day, I would have probably continued to make bigger and bigger bets until I finally lost it all. Typical gambler's fallacy. 

The $25K lesson I learned was trite but very humbling - NEVER play with more than what you can afford to lose! Which also means YOLOs are out of the question.

Bitcoin price data around halvings (time from halving until bull run),"For the 2nd halving, which occurred on July 16th, 2016, it was approximately 284 days before BTC began its bull run. For the 3rd halving, which occurred on May 11th, 2020, it was approximately 161 days before BTC started its bull run (I keep saying ""approximately"" because it's subjective, I picked a date to mark the beginning of the bull run that looked right to *me*, others will have different opinions). This is a reduction in time between halvings and the beginning of a genuine bull run of 43.3%. If we were to see this occur again in 2024, that would mean that there will be 69.7 days between the halving and the beginning of a bull run, placing it around **June 29th, 2024** (presuming the halving occurs on the estimated date of April 20th). Make of this what you will.

Note: we didn't have ETFs, MSTR, and some of the other shit that we do now, when the previous halvings occurred. I don't know what that means, precisely. I would guess that it will reduce the space in between the halving and the next bull run even more, but I don't know that, obviously.

Took a $35k loss and couldn't be happier,"First off, I was up $38,000 between mid February and 3/8.

My nightmare started on 3/8 at  beginning of market. I opened the following positions:

4/19 NVDA $1100c x3

4/19 NVDA $1200c x20

4/19 SPY $525c x20

Everything started great, was up $25k at 520am local time. Went for a morning run at 530am. Came home an hour later and looked at my portfolio to see the massive decline NVDA took from the $974 ATH moments before my run to an hour later. In a panic, I opened more positions:

3/15 NVDA $920c x5

3/15 SPY $515 X20

My cost basis was now around $75k. Completely over leveraged and overwhelmed. There was one day, Tuesday 3/12, where I could have closed my 3/15 NVDA calls after JPOW gave CPI report and everything bounced, but I missed it due to a work meeting. NVDA was up $30 overnight, but fell hard before market open.

At one point, I was $50k down and internally freaking the fuck out. I never meant to be so far leveraged, losing my entire 38k gain, and losing another 12k-15k. I fucked up, bad.

Long story short, I was able to close all my SPY positions for a small gain. But, my NVDA options were so far OTM, and I bought when NVDA was around $960, that theta and IV just crushed them.

All positions are finally closed, and I lost 35k. Somehow, I am still up about $2700 for the year, and I'll fucking take it. I lost the gains that I won by being greedy, getting lucky, and putting my family's hard earned fucking money on the line.

I experienced - first fucking hand - exactly what happens when you're over leveraged and a trade turns against you. I should have taken that God damn 25k gain on the morning of 3/8.

I have learned so, so much from digging deep within myself the past couple weeks and suffering internal shame, guilt, stress, frustration, etc., but also being serious about what I did wrong, and how to avoid such disaster. 

Do not get greedy. Take the fucking profit. You can always reenter.

Set a fucking stop loss.

Do not purchase 75k worth of options if you do not want to lose 75k,  because you absolutely can lose the whole God damn thing.

Take a fucking loss and close a losing position. Do not continue to ""hope"" things will turn around. A losing position is a loser. Deal with it.

Do not listen to the fucking idiots on Reddit with their bullshit posts saying ""NVDA part deux electric bugaloo to the fucking moon by Friday"". People don't know fuck all about fuck all. 

There it is. What a fucking shit show. Time to slow down, relax, and try again.

Why Lululemon Shares Are Falling Today,"Shares of athletic apparel and accessories retailer Lululemon (NASDAQ:LULU) fell 18.9% in the morning session after the company reported fourth-quarter results and provided full-year revenue and earnings guidance, which fell short of Wall Street's estimates. On the other hand, Lululemon slightly topped analysts' revenue and EPS expectations during the quarter. The company's growth was driven by a 12% increase in its same-store sales, with American stores growing 7% and international stores growing 44% on a constant currency basis. Overall, it was a weaker quarter for Lululemon.

The stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks.

Apple Loses $115 Billion in Market Value as Regulators Close In,"Regulators on both sides of the Atlantic are training their eyes on Apple Inc., unnerving investors with fears over fines and threatening its market dominance.

In the US, the Justice Department and 16 attorneys general are suing the iPhone maker for violating antitrust laws. And in Europe, the company is said to be facing probes about whether it’s complying with the region’s Digital Markets Act.

Shares of the company slid more than 4% Thursday, erasing about $115 billion in market value and taking their year-to-date loss back past 11%. Once the world’s most valuable firm at more than $3 trillion, Apple has underperformed both the Nasdaq 100 and the S&P 500 in 2024.

Apple sued by Biden administration and 16 state and district attorneys over alleged iPhone 'monopoly power',"Among the suit's allegations:

-Apple prevents the successful deployment of what the DOJ calls ""super apps"" that would make it easier for consumers to switch between smartphone platforms.

-Apple blocks the development of cloud-streaming apps that would allow for high-quality video-game play without having to pay for extra hardware.

-Apple inhibits the development of cross-platform messaging apps so that customers must keep buying iPhones.

In a statement, Apple denied the allegations and accused the government of overreach.

“At Apple, we innovate every day to make technology people love —designing products that work seamlessly together, protect people’s privacy and security, and create a magical experience for our users,"" it said. ""This lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets. If successful, it would hinder our ability to create the kind of technology people expect from Apple—where hardware, software, and services intersect. It would also set a dangerous precedent, empowering government to take a heavy hand in designing people’s technology. We believe this lawsuit is wrong on the facts and the law, and we will vigorously defend against it.”

"As the next Warren buffet, who predicted FDX and NKE earnings correctly this is my next play.","So for earnings I correctly [predicted](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/8MHQMyrWdo) FedEx going up and Nike going down which means I’m the chosen one and can’t make mistakes so this is my next prediction. 

For earnings this week there really isn’t much going on except the one stock most people on here joined because of. And there are some other decent plays like Cintas (CTAS) which is a great company that I’m bullish on but options are very expensive.

So this is my prediction. McCormick and Company (MKC) will go up for two reason only. We passed the holidays where people made turkeys and to make a good turkey you need seasoning and who makes seasoning. MKC. That means it has to go up.

Possibility of Upcoming Mergers: Targeted Alpha Therapy companies,"In the last few months, two targeted alpha therapy (TAT) companies have been snapped up in mergers.  Both paid out a ~100% premium over the share price. 

I can only find two other publicly-traded companies in that space: CATX and DRTS.

I'm not going to explain what TAT is unless you ask. I assume finely regarded people like yourselves are well-educated, curious, and capable.

Both RYZB and FUSN sold for ~$2 billion.  If either CATX or DRTS were purchased for a similar amount, the share prices would be ~$3 and $25, respectively.

So in the best case, CATX has 100% upside and DRTS is much higher.

I have no clue if either are any good.

Here are links for the two that merged already: [RYZB](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bristol-myers-squibb-completes-acquisition-133500439.html) and [FUSN.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fusion-fusn-99-2-4b-172100147.html)

Was Josh Brown Right or Wrong about Nvidia? 😂,"
Does anyone remember this beautiful moment? First, let me be clear. I love The Compound and Friends Podcast. So much so that I started a Reddit community. However, I have to be completely honest about what I witnessed in February. 

During the early stages of Nvidia’s bull run, Josh came out on CNBC and said he trimmed his position by 20%. I was shocked! I thought to myself, this thing hasn’t even warmed up yet. Looking back, I think I made the right move to hold….BUT, alternatively, does anyone think Josh was right?

COIN: The next 50x play,"Alright boys. First, check out my username. I’ve been in crypto for a long time just to trade and have called every single BTC top. I’ve had puts on BTC since 73k (proof: https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/s/ryWIFUSMWV). Check the downvotes. But you know what, this play doesn’t even rely on BTC. Heck it could go to 100-150k for all I care (it won’t) but one thing is for sure: 

COIN is going down. Why? 

1. Their customer service is absolute crap. They only just started phone support after many years and none of them can even speak English 

2. **Every single** fast BTC move results in the exchange being shut down. This has been a problem on their exchange for many years with no fix in sight. **Not a single other major crypto exchange** (Binance/Bitmex/Deribit/etc) has this problem despite having **more** volume than Coinbase 

3. The IV isn’t atrocious like it is on MSTR yet and not many shorts on the stock hence no ensuing squeeze. Most of you regards can actually afford it   

4. Brian Armstrong’s wife has been cheating on him

5. I have puts

6. (And this is probably most important): ETF inflows are slowing down. These ETFs use coinbase for a lot of their higher volume buys. Less volume = less revenue for coinbase

Marketwise (MKTW) are going to massively beat their Q1 earnings,"So most of you are probably never gonna have heard about this company and those that have probably think it's dogshit. Marketwise is a company that sells stock newsletters. Yeah, I know. It's one of those companies that makes fake news articles about the stock market written by a AI or some Indian guy on Fiver. They then try to funnel these clicks into their paid newsletters. If you ever have gotten a bunch of spam emails for ""top 5 hidden AI gems that will 20x your portfolio"" then you probably are on Marketwise email list.

Now Marketwise products sucks. There is no denying that. That could also be a opportunity though. I think we all can agree that the market is extremely hot right now. There are lots of new investors that just wanna get into the market and have no clue about anything. This is gonna be the first quarter where the market is back into mania mode since 2021. This benefits Marketwise immensely. People want to get rich and they want to get rich quickly. In 2021 Marketwise revenue hit an all time high. In part that was because they massively increased advertising but it was also due to a lot of just general market mania. Everything was hitting all time highs and everyone wanted to find the next memestock Now I see a lot of parallels to now. Nvidia is flying to insane valuations and bringing loads of bad stocks (any soundhound baggies here lul) with it just through pure market euphoria. 

Marketwise as a company has performed terribly basically forever. They went public via a spac in 2021 and have basically went straight down with some bumps here and there since. This is despite the fact that their business plan should be really profitable. I mean they are basically selling random stocks that are trending for thousands of dollars to people who don't know better. I mean they have billings for 650k per employee. That's as high as some tech stocks. The CEO also revealed they will not make the same mistakes as in previous years where they increased the spending instead of focusing on their margins. They are already cutting personnel and focusing on efficiency in their marketing.

They also have a 120 millions dollars in float apparently. What's float you ask? Well it just so happens to be Warren Buffets favorite thing. It's money that they can't report as earnings yet but still get to hold on hand. And while they have that money they can earn interest on it. Now with interest rates being high earning a cool 3-4% should be really easy for them meaning that not only do they have a strong reason to have great increases in sales. They might also report a good chunk of change from interest on their float.

Marketwise is being valued as being dead in the water. Extremely few people know about this company and even those that do have all but dismissed it as a scam heading for bankruptcy. I disagree and so does an insider executive too apparently since he bought 25k worth of Marketwise stock 2 days ago.

When they release their Q1 earnings which I think will be really good I suspect this stock could go up as much as 50%. They haven't announced when they will report their Q1 earnings but based on previous years they usually do around the second week of May. Until then I will be buying as much of their cheap stock as I can.

$SAVA short - Alzheimers drug maker forgets to follow the rules,"""Cassava Sciences, Inc., a clinical stage biotechnology company, develops drugs for neurodegenerative diseases. Its lead therapeutic product candidate is simufilam, a small molecule drug, which is completed Phase 2 clinical trial"".

They were mired with controversy when it was found that Wang, a co-developer of simufilam, had falsified data in early testing. [https://www.science.org/content/article/co-developer-cassava-s-potential-alzheimer-s-drug-cited-egregious-misconduct](https://www.science.org/content/article/co-developer-cassava-s-potential-alzheimer-s-drug-cited-egregious-misconduct)

That tanked the stock and we're at around 20 but I strongly believe there is much more room to fall. There's a pending lawsuit against the company from shareholders, and it's undergoing phase 3 which is likely to fail given the shoddiness of the science behind it. 

Here's their response 

[https://www.cassavasciences.com/news-releases/news-release-details/statement-cassava-sciences-regarding-internal-cuny-report-leaked#:\~:text=The%20short%2Dsellers%20alleged%20that,other%20forms%20of%20research%20misconduct](https://www.cassavasciences.com/news-releases/news-release-details/statement-cassava-sciences-regarding-internal-cuny-report-leaked#:~:text=The%20short%2Dsellers%20alleged%20that,other%20forms%20of%20research%20misconduct).

They have distanced themselves from Wang and claimed that their current research is independent from the findings of Wang, and that many of the issues have to do with ""improper record keeping""

My neuroscience PHD friend says this in response

""Wang's research is literally the entire basis of their stated MOA. I have never been more sure of the science, just when the market catches up is a guess.

Also look at their phase 2 biomarker study. They initially got their biomarkers tested by the leader in the field who found absolutely zero effect of the drug. Then a month later they said that analysis was wrong and an ""independent lab"" had retested and found literally every marker to have significantly dropped. That ""independent"" lab turned out to be Wang, who didn't even use correct procedures and most likely faked it all (the short group I'm in did an analysis showing that the results he got are a statistical impossibility). It's faked all the way through ""

This is a long play - this stock has a tendency to stick around way longer than it should. It also often has a few random pumps so today might not be the best day to enter. I suspect a decent amount of manipulation is happening since their market cap is less than a billion and volume is low. 

I have may and august dated puts at around 15 and 12.5 strike.

"Jimmy March 26th, market close Q4 earnings","Aside from Black Friday/Christmas, video game sales will be very strong due to the fall releases of new games dominating charts for the year. I’ve cherry picked the titles relating to large sales volume in Q4. This data is for physical copies, it doesn’t include copies downloaded.

Source: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-01-19/four-big-takeaways-from-the-bestselling-video-games-of-2023

20 bestselling games of 2023 — ranked by dollar sales:

1. Hogwarts Legacy
-Release date February 2023
-Release date for Switch, November 14, 2023

Sales surpassed 15 million copies prior to Switch release. Hogwarts sales ended the year with 22 million sold to take the #1 spot. It took the #3 spot for Switch in only 6 weeks.

2. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III (2023)
-Release date November 10, 2023

Mw3 took the #2 spot for only 7 weeks of availability. I can’t find the sales numbers for that period but Zelda took the #5 spot with 19.5 million. This puts it in the 20-22 million range.

3. Madden NFL 24 [EA Sports]
-Release date August 18th 2023

Madden came out in Q3 but still took the #4 best selling game in November. Sales were more spread out during the year than a huge burst on release.

4. Marvel’s Spider-Man 2
-Release date October 20th 2023

Spider-Man sold 2.5 million copies on release and over 10 million by year end.

7. Mortal Kombat 1
-Release date September 19 2023

Q3 release with strong Q4 sales.

11. Super Mario Bros. Wonder
-Release date October 20th 2023

12 million units sold in 2023. Wonder makes #11 on this list because this figure includes downloaded sales. Nintendo stated it’s the fastest selling Mario game ever. Physical sales will be very high.

Best Buy has already released Q4 earnings. It’s video game sales are included within its entertainment category. Sales for the category increased 8.4%, however this also includes dvd, blu-ray and other items that have been falling out of favour. If they reported just gaming it would be much higher. https://www.mediaplaynews.com/best-buy-q4-entertainment-revenue-increased-driven-by-video-games/

I’m betting it will be much higher, but if we apply the 8.4% growth to previous years Q4 $670 million software sales that’s a growth of $56 million.

RC business plan has been to close under performing stores and lower Selling, General and Administration expenses as much as possible. So far in 2023 the previous quarters SGA was reduced $107 million in Q1, $65 million in Q2 and $91 million in Q3. If we apply this years average reduction of $87 million to Q4, as well as the 8.4% gaming increase it points to a quarterly profit of over $180 million ($0.60 eps), I think it will be even higher. Analysts are saying $0.29 eps.

Last quarter with a small profit the stock ran to $19, last year with a $48 million Q4 profit it ran to $25. At $13.xx it makes a great trading opportunity. 

My trading position consists of 50 ITM, 20 OTM calls, 1800 shares, 37 bull spreads and selling of 5 cash secured puts. Long 1000 shares in another account 🟣

"Weed, and why it's time. ","So. Let's get the green elephant out of the room. Weed will become readily available for sale to the general public estimated September 2024.

Marijuana has, and had been increasing in recreational use expentially over the last decade. The FDA has recently just called to drop marijuana from a Schedule 1, to Schedule 3 drug as restrictions on the funny tomato plant begin to drop.

This has opened up and exponential growth in sales quarter after quarter, with no signs of stopping. 

Market saturation? You wish. Bad product gets sold at a discount while high quality cannabis is still flying off shelves. 

Candles. A buncha green. Like weed. Coincidence? I think not. 

CRON, ACB, CGC? Okay grandpa. Try MJ, YOLO, MSOX, and REFI. ETFS and ACTUAL profitable businesses. 

Cannabis stocks have been a big fat hefty joke since 2020, as investors expected profit from companies who were sibking their funds into investing into land, and facilities to accommodate their crop.

Time to make it SNOW some easy gains,"SNOW is a stock that killed earnings and smashed revenue at +99.56% and +31.53% respectively. Price pre earnings was 230 but right now it’s sitting at 165 with an average target price for the stock is 217.

www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/snow/analystestimates

Why is this? Because their old CEO retired so they revised guidance to a super conservative position, a “welcome gift” if you will. Super conservative being a 22% increase in revenue instead of a 38% increase.

https://s26.q4cdn.com/463892824/files/doc_financials/2024/q4/Q4-FY24-Earnings-Call-Transcript.pdf?utm_cta=ty-data-trends-2023-data-ai

This company is growing and scaling up, making their money by selling scalable data storage and collaboration tools within organizations. This means the more customers they acquire, the better deals they can negotiate with vendors to boost their profit margins.

www.investors.com/news/technology/snowflake-snow-stock-buy-now/

Based on the last year alone gross profit margin was up 78% due to their accelerated growth, but even at their conservative growth rate of 22% they are poised to be pulling in 76%, which they will most likely smash given their revision is simply based on a new CEO.

Hitting a bottom at 150 and rebounding upwards gives the stock a lot of room to grow before their next earnings which they will annihilate resulting in a mega boost in price.

It’s about to hit the 200MA at 175 with healthy skew growing above 167.5 and 170 so traders are bullish on this.

$HIMS (dick pill company) has mooned and continue to moon until supremum - part 2,"&#x200B;

Hello it's reek again.  And disclaimer my handle is literally reek. It's not a sexy name, it's not a name that speaks to power, it doesn't even sound good when you say it.... it's reek. If it had a smell it would smell like butt cheese... you know that glue between your ass during a hot summer day when you forgot to use a dudewipe. Anyone who wipes their ass with just toilet paper.... I'm looking at you... disgusting. And stop wearing socks all the time it's weird we all know you have foot fungus it's a dead give away. Fix your damn feet!!!! Where was I.... oh yah.. so if you listen to me you deserve to lose money.

I said I would post a update  if people actually read  the post, and you bastards actually did! Surprising, and congrats you lost some IQ points.  Anyway, was having trouble coming up w/ a update because the original post was a such a concise fundamental breakdown of the bull case for $HIMS. However, that changed the other night ...So I popped a hims dick mint before mounted this chick. I lasted  5min b4 nutting not bad but a a new record me (4min longer than usual),  so I was feeling  great!! then the post nut clarity hit and things stopped being linear and I saw connections everywhere pure enlightenment and in that moment I realized the magnitude of the opportunitny (*btw post nut clarity is a real thing sex energy is the  energy of creation so if you bust that nut strong enough you see god - ""Think and Grow Rich"" by Napolean Hill*). Two thoughts came into my mind: 

1.  the only  occupation a person keeps when they win the lottery ... crack hoe 
2.  if u think hard enough a dick pill can fix anything.

Ive gone down the rabithole and have verified (w/ 100% cold hard facts) that dick pills can in fact fix anything. The war, the election Mango vs the geriatric, ice spice (so so sexy).... everything pales in comparison to what I'm about to reveal..... clench your buttholes I'm abouut to take you on a journey....

Pop a boner mint and finally feel something for once. Instead of fucking go to a park with your swinging dick and meditate on a flower. Ignore the boner and see the beauty of the flower & its oneness with the universe. 

.......

This is why $HIMS will dominate they recognize a truth about life. A core truth . Hard cock = happy life. Even if your 22 and ur dick works fine, pop that boner mint no harm. And these vigilantes  are spreading the word of GOD, just like Buddha, Jesus, John Smtih (the Mormon). Once your  on the pill you realize it fixes EVERYTHING IN YOUR LIFE. Think of the ramifications. 

Also from personal experience subscriptions to the pills are surprisingly hard to cancel. Your like yup I'll take these pills every month and only use half of them... they beat you into submission. Great business model.

MRNA: Remember That Falling Knife? I Think It's Hit Bottom (And a RARE Adam and Eve Pattern is Forming on the Weekly Chart),"Three months ago, I dared to tread where many portfolios went to bleed – calling a potential bottom on Moderna (MRNA)  [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/18llx12/buy\_the\_rumor\_on\_mrna/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/18llx12/buy_the_rumor_on_mrna/).

The ""Covid stock"" was a graveyard of failed bottom-fishing attempts... but I saw something different, just like I did with SQ (check out that successful call here) [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/17r7p3z/block\_inc\_sq\_high\_probability\_technical\_bullish/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/17r7p3z/block_inc_sq_high_probability_technical_bullish/).

**The Technicals Were Right (Again) – And This RARE Weekly Pattern is Emerging**

Those bullish signals I outlined back in November? They're evolving beautifully, and something even more compelling has emerged on the weekly chart: a classic Adam and Eve double bottom pattern. This isn't just any pattern – it's known for its power in signaling bullish reversals, and it's especially significant when it appears on a longer-term timeframe like a weekly chart.

* **Adam's Dive (Nov 2023):** That sharp drop formed the first bottom (Adam).
* **Eve's Softer Landing (Feb 2024):** A rounder, gradual bottom (Eve) suggests buyers are stepping back in.
* **The Rarity Factor:** Adam and Eve patterns don't show up every day, and their presence on a weekly chart makes this one even more significant.
* **Momentum Divergence & More:** The other signals (divergence, Heikin Ashi, money flow) are still backing this up.

**Crucial Breakout Needed:**  For true confirmation, we need a decisive close above the high of $115.97 (from Jan 8th, 2024).

[Weekly MRNA Chart](https://preview.redd.it/p3eidcljqypc1.png?width=2270&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f0770a72e625ade881cf1e31fe6d33d632348b3)

**The News Backs It Up**

Remember that Merck/Moderna skin cancer vaccine update? The market does – and it seems to love the Adam and Eve setup forming alongside this news. And while those declining COVID booster numbers sting for some, Moderna's superior efficacy and revolutionary technology shines brighter than ever.  Moreover, notable investors like Cathie Wood have stepped up their position in MRNA noted in an an article ironically titled, ""Is Cathie Wood Buying the Rumor?"" (Welcome to the party Cathie).

**My Money's Where My Chart Is**

I've been building my MRNA position, and the technicals suggest it's not too late to join in. Let's be real, institutions aren't panicking –  which is usually a good sign for us contrarians.

As always, don't take my word for it...noted technical analyst Thomas Bulkowski has a lot to say about the Adam & Eve pattern here...[https://thepatternsite.com/aedb.html](https://thepatternsite.com/aedb.html)

Clearing up DWAC misinformation,"So I've seen a few claims that are just baseless with all the DWAC hype so this post is just clearing up some of the popular ones with sources.

1. ""Trump will onload shares as soon as the merger happens""...  Business insider and gaurdian claim any larger shareholder of this company will not be allowed to sell until 6 months after merge (including trump)
2. ""The stock wont change ticker name to DJT""... According to Businessinsider linked below the company will receive an updated Symbol DJT for trading if the deal is approved.
3. ""merger wont go thru""... Trump is literally already suing those shareholders unwilling to cooperate in this vote and with this final meeting coming up tomorrow there is a chance it wont happen but with all the potential money to lose it'd be a disadvantage to vote against this merger now for any shareholder.

DD Bitcoin Double-Bottom Play,"DD of Bitcoin's latest saga, and what I think is a signal...

we find ourselves at a critical juncture. After reaching an ATH of \~$73.8K, Bitcoin experienced a sharp decline to $60,900, rallied to nearly $68K, and is now on a trajectory towards the $61-$62K range. This sequence is not random market behavior but appears to be sculpting a classic **double-bottom pattern**, signaling a potentially bullish turnaround. If this doesn't looks like a 'W' then I don't know what does...

&#x200B;

[damn girl, you got some nice curves](https://preview.redd.it/nzmd6qhfowpc1.png?width=1766&format=png&auto=webp&s=bded943217c38221a71aef12601f270a1aca0b04)

**The significance of this pattern forming around the $61-$62K mark cannot be overstated.** It indicates a strong market consensus that Bitcoin, at this level, represents a substantial buying opportunity--a rare double bottom, aka 'W'. This moment could very well mark the shift in narrative, reinforcing the value Bitcoin holds in the eyes of investors ESPECIALLY with the halving just 28-29 days away.

Grayscale's decision to significantly reduce its Bitcoin holdings adds another layer of complexity. This move has prompted a flurry of activity, with some investors quick to sell off, possibly eyeing the allure of lower-fee ETFs. This shake-up serves as a litmus test, separating bishass 🧻🤲 spooked by short-term volatility from the steadfast believers in Bitcoin’s long-term promise.

**The rebound from the $61-$62K range will be pivotal.** A robust bounce back, particularly if supported by significant trading volume, would solidify the bullish implications of the double-bottom pattern.

The challenge now is to breach the resistance near $68K. Surpassing this level would not just signal recovery but could also mark the beginning of a new bullish phase for Bitcoin...

Based on the Fibonacci extension levels calculated from the most recent low of $16,246 and the previous cycle's high of $65,483 for Bitcoin, if the 'W' forms...the potential next All Time Highs (ATHs) could be around:

* **161.8% extension level:** Approximately $145,148
* **261.8% extension level:** Approximately $194,385
* **423.6% extension level:** Approximately $274,051

If you're a real nuggethead and want to double-down on a more leveraged play, this is where **MSTR** Calls would be a ballsy move right now.

Grayscale's strategic divestment and the market's response underscore the volatile, yet resilient nature of Bitcoin. This episode is a clear test of investor cajones, distinguishing 🧻🤲 vs. 💎🤲.

**Your move.**

Puts on NKE (Nike)

Nike might be all about ""Just Do It,"" but I'm here to tell you to just short it. Why? Because Nike's been riding high on hype for too long. Their recent shoe releases? Meh. The market's saturated, the shoes suck nowadays. So, short the swoosh.

Going Long on FDX (FedEx)

Now, onto the tendies. FDX, baby! FedEx is the ultimate underdog ready to take flight.

With the holiday season past us, we're talking about packages flying off the shelves faster than Elon's tweets. And guess who's cashing in on that? That's right, FDX. Plus, they're expanding their footprint internationally, so we're not just talking domestic tendies here – it's global, baby.

NKE puts for all you regards that lost money through TSM,"For all you regards who lost all your money this week, gather round cuz you can make it all back with puts on $NKE. 📉🔥

First off, these earnings coming up? They ain't lookin' pretty. Analysts getting cold feet and slashing those EPS and revenue estimates like there's no tomorrow. Revenue estimated to be down 1% YoY, operating income down 7%, EPS down 6%...I'm talking fiscal Q3 '24 lookin' like a dumpster fire. 🗑️🔥

China used to be Nike's golden goose but now it's turning into a lead balloon. Politics messin' with the brand and Winnie the Pooh ain't playin' nice no more. 🇨🇳💩 If China sneezes, Nike catches a cold.

Also, wanted to cop me some fresh Nikes from Footlocker the other day but they were out of my size. And those sales peeps couldn't care less about finding me an alternative. Nike losing mindshare on the sales floor, you heard it here first. 😤

Now I ain't no 🌈🐻 but facts are facts. EPS estimates down 11% in the last year, revenue estimates slashed by 5-9%. Free cash flow yield finally hitting 4% - first time since 2019! Too little too late if you ask me. 📉

Technical traders getting ready to short this to the earth's core if it breaks $82. Morningstar trying to prop it up with that cute lil $136 ""fair value"" but internal models ain't buying it, putting it between $85-100 tops. 📊

Nike might've bounced back from that ""brown shoe craze"" in the 90s but this feels different. Inventory to revenue ratios just getting back to normal after 3 brutal quarters...and who knows if this is the new normal. 📦📉

So unless JPow turns on the money printer again or Xi Jinping starts rocking Jordans, I'm staying the hell away from $NKE. Puts on deck, maybe nibble on some lottos if it craters post-earnings. 💸🎰

TL;DR - Nike r fuk, inversing Morningstar and buying puts on anything above $100. See you on the moon...or in the food stamps line. 🚀🍜

$LULU Earnings Call Play,"Picked up a $LULU call expiring 3/28 ahead of their earnings call today post-market. 🚀

After seeing some WSB regards talking about the slew of weight loss drugs hitting the market last year, being approved by health insurance providers, more women are going to be interested in showing off their bodies. Because of this, and the usual Q4 holiday earnings, I am anticipating a positive earnings report. I'm banking on potential catalysts like revenue growth, margins, and guidance updates. A beat and raise scenario could send the stock up \~$50.

Market sentiment and macroeconomic factors could sway the outcome. It's a calculated gamble, but one with potential for handsome rewards.

So, I'm keeping a close eye on this play, looking for signs of bullish momentum and managing risk accordingly.

The next Semi-conductor / Data center play: Vertiv (VRT),"This stock has already been ripping for a while, and, like SMCI, I think it's gonna keep going parabolic. Why, you may ask? Well, let me tell you. If you watched the NVIDIA Keynote, there's something you probably missed due to your extra chromosome: If you want the most powerful Blackwell configuration, you're going to need a liquid cooling setup in your data center.

Guess what - most data centers do not currently have liquid cooling infrastructure to just plug and play your fancy new Blackwell rack.

Guess who is one of the few companies who companies who make liquid cooling infrastructure for data centers? Vertiv.

NVIDIA basically just put all the data center companies on notice: Get your shit modernized with liquid cooling, or get left behind. Blackwell is a few quarters out, and data centers are going to have to start modernizing now if they want to capture this business. Not to mention that this is likely to become the industry standard going forward as chips become more powerful, power hungry, and create more heat that can no longer be managed with air cooling. Vertiv orders are going to go off the hook - their stock already jumped 10% immediately after the NVIDIA GTC Keynote because people with brains started buying.

Their earnings are going to be some time in late April. I expect that they will guide to the moon, and the stock will follow. Check out the earnings ramp from the last 4 quarters:

Why Viking Therapeutics (VKTX) is your ticket to raiding Wall Street (Analysis from a Regar.D),"Hello fellow regards, it’s time to load up on VKTX calls!!! When I visited their HQ last week, I was surprised to see that instead of some nerds developing drugs, everyone was actually a viking. Initially, I was frightened, seeing these behemoths with their war paint, epic beards, and hulking axes. What were they doing here? However, after speaking to their CEO (Ragnar Lothbrook) he told me that they stole a time travel machine when they raided Rome and used it to come here to set their sights on their next target: Wall Street. 

Okay it hurts my head to type like this so now I’ll actually tell you why you should buy VKTX. VKTX is currently developing a GLP-1 agonist (same class of drug as Ozempic, Mounjaro, and Zepbound) AKA the big chungus people drug. As many of you know from NVO and LLY’s recent moves, GLP-1 agonists are basically the AI of biopharma with some of the highest demands of any drug out there. Now here is why I’m buying VKTX instead of these power houses:

1) VKTX oral data: Here’s why I’m loading up on short term calls; the readout for the Phase 1 Oral trial for VK2735 is due before the end of March. Initially, this stock sold off from $95 due to NVO’s positive oral weight loss drug’s results. However, these results were fraudulent asf; sure the efficacy results were on the higher end, but over 50% of patients dropped out, and the sample size was composed exclusively of Japanese people. Ragnar’s oral data projections are 1-2%, however he’s lowballed before with their injectable weight loss drug (this hard out-performed expectations and caused the stock to rocket to $95). 

2) VKTX injectable: I’m too lazy to type out the reasons but basically they have the best GLP-1 agonist currently in development. They have almost a 100% chance of being bought out by some big name, I just have no idea when. Load up on leaps, the further out the better. Eli Lilly already offered a buyout at $50/share before they blew up and it’s rumored another big company offered a buyout at $85/share which they also refused. 

3) Not just a one trick pony: Ragnar isn’t putting all his eggs in one basket he’s also developing VK2809 and VK0214, for NASH and X-ALD respectively. Expect amazing data (Regar.D analysis right here) when the trial results are updated in April for VK2809. 

4) Earnings April 24th: Ignore this cause earnings are practically useless, but you should see a nice volatility spike here to sell into before earnings. 

Positions: 3/28 calls @ $85/90 (playing the oral readout data here), 4/26 calls @ $100 (playing the NASH data and if it’s not out will sell the day before earnings), 1/17/25 calls @ 135 (just playing the buyout possibility here, if you have more money try playing the 2026 calls)

TL;DR: Viking Therapeutics is being run by Ragnar and his fellow vikings who stole a time travel machine!!! Oral data is due before the end of march, NASH data and earnings in April, and a buyout on the horizon.

Wells Fargo And Their $1B Scandal Saga,"As WFC is up 15% this year, they keep their good dynamic (CNBC) since their loudest fake accounts scandal. And analytics say that they would go even higher this year (but I doubt it tho). 

So, I guess many of you heard about one of the biggest payment in history and also one of the loudest cases. So, the story started many years ago, in 2016, when Wells Fargo created millions of unauthorized customer accounts and imposed auto insurance on hundreds of thousands of clients.

Following that, in 2018, Federal Reserve issued several orders. For years WFC's been working under consent order, meanwhile reporting to investors significant improvements and not mentioning any compliance issues.

They were able to hide it until March 20th, and it only became known when the government disclosed this situation and the order issues. And right after the reports were published their stock obviously dropped.

Several months ago, Wells Fargo decided to pay damaged shareholders $1B while denying all the ""wrongdoings"". And they say that investors who traded WFC still can try to apply for the payment, so you [can check it](https://11thestate.com/cases/wells-fargo-settlement).

Anyway, even with the latest WFC situation, I am not sure they can beat their all time high in the future.

After All That Shit Talk You Guys Are Posting Reddit Buys Like True Internet Nerds  ,"Of course everyone that said they were buying puts isn’t. You guys always do the inverse of what you say. 

I don’t know where the money came from to hit the top range because they were still sending those stock emails asking people to participate last night. 

I guess you guys pulled them through the finish line in typical WSB fashion.

Anyway. Good luck tomorrow. It’s gonna be a shit show here.

Also, I just left the Nvidia conference and what a disaster that was.

You don’t want to know where those $50k chips went after the Key note. People were still blowing micro processors out their nose at breakfast this morning.

It was clearly obvious this was the future. 

These guys couldn’t figure out how to properly build a better chip so they just glued two together and said they operate as one and that was true last night. 

It sounds like the developers cashed all their vested options and checked the fuck out completely.

They don’t have to fulfill all these promises and fantasy talks and actually deliver on the most ambitious plan ever constructed in the history of capitalism.

Not only that, they need every big tech company to join them at the hip forever while everyone else is concocting their own secret plans to fuck everyone else just like Dune. 

Life was much simpler when Mary left her briefcase at the airport and Lloyd and Harry traveled across the country to return it.

$GCT—Potential big opportunity? Masked by uncertainty and battling narratives!,"GCT is a tech/fulfillment logistics company that is insanely cheap by traditional metrics. It's growing revenues at 40% YoY, and is trading at a low FCF multiple while in hypergrowth. *If legit*, it's numbers mean a fair valuation compared to, say, Amazon, would be 5x from here in terms of EV/OFCF.

So why is it not there? Well, it's been accused of being a scam:

1. [Culper Research short report](https://culperresearch.com/) (gone up 400% since this btw)
   1. The bulk of the thesis was they observed warehouses and did not see much activity, and there were doctored photos showing warehouses being full. Please read it in full.
2. Even on WSB there's lots of speculation about [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bjhunm/is_gigacloud_technology_nasdaq_gct_a_scam/)

And recently, it sold off 33% AFTER releasing insane earnings where it beat EPS .83c to mid 50c and grew revenue at nearly 100% YoY!

https://preview.redd.it/s9u7e1rk6ppc1.png?width=1162&format=png&auto=webp&s=db8e2f407e43eeee5993396d9bced8a41b9f6006

However, what you might not know is that a manager on Value Investors Club (stock writeup site where Michael Burry and others used to post) literally camped outside GCT warehouses to observe that there is business activity going on. They also inspected the warehouses, refuted many of the points in the report, etc. I can't share it but you can make a free account and check it out.

**Anyways, this is the important part. The 33% selloff has imo largely been due to a filing delay. Failing to file a Form 10-K on time appeared super sketchy to the market when a company is already regarded as suspicious. HOWEVER:**

[fine print!](https://preview.redd.it/myxmvo0g7ppc1.png?width=2084&format=png&auto=webp&s=878a78945f1f1d48fbfd4cb088aa7037cd9d1ca6)

*So if you actually read the reason why, you see it's that they want to become a domestic US filer rather than a foreign Chinese filer. This would INCREASE scrutiny and they would go from being audited by a foreign company to being audited by a US accounting firm! In my opinion, this would be an insane decision if the company was indeed a scam.*

**Tl;dr:**

1. You have a stock in hypergrowth trading at an insanely low valuation
2. The stock was the target of a short report, but another (likely) institutional investor refuted this report for their fund
3. Still, the rumors linger, so the 10-K delay tanked the price
4. The delay has an insanely reasonable explanation and in fact, imo, **makes it far less likely that the company is indeed a scam!**
5. This is a massive opportunity (in my opinion) because we already ""know"" the earnings which were prereleased and caused a 23% pop at the time:

https://preview.redd.it/avwzawy38ppc1.png?width=1334&format=png&auto=webp&s=168afb3945d9935ae22fffe960211d67b87df8d5

[Not half bad results, eh?](https://preview.redd.it/hlanqzkw8ppc1.png?width=826&format=png&auto=webp&s=e7bcec2bcaef8694b1c491846ddf2a83ffc4d740)

Now here's how I am playing. The updated 10-K should come out fairly soon, typically it takes several weeks. This should serve to ""derisk"" GCT in the eyes of the market, and I see no reason why it wouldn't trade back up to where it was, and even higher. Additionally, others may close shorts if the narrative changes. Therefore I am long May 17 40C in expectation of this catalyst:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gvcewnne8ppc1.jpg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c9ec48fc67e1ff7ef2c5f15074743f765c044c9e

Now here are the risks:

1. I have no idea how to really analyze a company. All I know is that you have two equally smart institutional investors battling it out. I personally found the bull more compelling, but many would not.
2. Insiders recently sold stock. I \*think\* but do not really know that this may be somewhat due to re-domiciling, but it may also be cashing out. However, the founder still owns a ton of shares. This is a guy whose stock went up 400% and he proposed to sell $5m. To me that is bullish.

https://preview.redd.it/504osoki9ppc1.png?width=2114&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c397f6e98e0d0da1b4773ac855caaa70ec538db

3. I am an absolute idiot and have no idea how to due accounting or valuation.

4. There is a lot of competition in the logistics industry and the short report in many ways did raise concerning points. You need to read it and do your own DD on both sides.

**Mega TL;DR**

1. **Stock goes up a ton.**
2. **What should be a non-event or a good-event (US domiciling) tanks it**
3. **After the air clears, stock goes back up a ton (?) and still would be undervalued**
4. **We can play this intelligently because there's a near term concrete catalyst**

Regarding Reddit IPO to other social media,"I have a dumb question

Reddit going public shows us info about the company's financials. Interesting points from the S1 filing include: 

* $804mil rev in 2023 (20% higher than 2022)
* Net loss of $90 mil in 2023
* Net loss of $158 mil in 2022
* Negative free cash flows $85 mil 2023
* Negative free cash flows $100 mil 2022
* price to sales multiple of nearly 8x
* Almost all revenue comes from advertisements
* Reddit warns in its S1 filing that ""if redditors do not continue to contribute content, or if the content isn't valuable to other redditors, we may experience a decline in number of redditors accessing our products and services which could result in loss of advertisers  and may harm our reputation, business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects,"" 

&#x200B;

My question is, isn't this exactly how facebook works? Requires content from users to maintain a user-base, as well as revenue from advertisers? Facebook earned $134 bil in revenue in 2023. Meta posted a net profit of $39 bil in 2023.

"In the near term, $RDDT is going to the moon. In the long term, Reddit as a company will collapse","Alright professors, what did we think of the Prospectus?  

Obviously, the IPO launch is slated to occur tomorrow and every moron on this sub and beyond will buy in purely out of FOMO. This will drive the price up, and the Call option lobby will keep the imbecilic bag holders clenching for weeks to come. In the short term, the price will balloon beyond all fundamental sense, and management will work tirelessly to prove the stock isn't overvalued (it is and always will be). 

Then the honeymoon will be over, and reddit will suffer the same fate as most other mainstream social media organizations. For starters, a brief once-over of their financials shows that Reddit has ran a massive deficit since inception and this will literally never change. Plus, you'll only get more censorship and heavy handed modding in order to make the platform more palatable to big-name advertisers. This pressure to scrutinize content will only chill content generation. Like it or not, people use sites like reddit to be exposed to a wilder, more unfiltered side of humanity. Pinterst and 4chan already exist, Reddit cannot pivot into something that will magically attract new users to the cite creating a miracle monetization regime. 

The golden age of Reddit has passed, if it ever existed. This IPO and the billions floated to reddit by the underwriters will never be paid back in full, long term. The pressure by shareholders upon the board to manipulate Reddit to become profitable will slowly kill the site and leave content generation stagnant through heavy-handed censorship and moderation. The desperate attempt to cling to an overvalued market price will destroy the company from the top throughout the long term.

"Why you should buy MU, earnings highlights (spoiler: they smashed it)","# **Bookmark this, remind me 4months etc.**

As you *probably* know MU absolutely destroyed earnings and I think most of you should see these numbers and guidance - in my opinion, this is only going to keep rising into next earnings.

Up until now it has been 5 straight losses for the last 5 q’s, and the AI boom has really helped them flourish… to quote their CEO

>""Our preeminent product portfolio positions us well to deliver a strong fiscal second half of 2024. **We believe Micron is one of the biggest beneficiaries in the semiconductor industry of the multiyear opportunity enabled by AI**.""

**Revenue:** $5.82 billion vs analyst estimates of $5.35 billion (8.8% beat)

**EPS (non-GAAP):** $0.42 vs analyst estimates of -$0.24 ($0.66 beat)

**Revenue Guidance for Q2 CY2024** is $6.6 billion at the midpoint, above analyst estimates of $6.00 billion

**Gross Margin (GAAP):** 18.5%, up from -32.7% in the same quarter last year

**Inventory Days Outstanding:** 162, up from 158 in the previous quarter

Free Cash Flow was -$29 million compared to -$395 million in the previous quarter

**Market Capitalization:** $103.8 billion

They expect 75.9% yoy revenue growth for the next quarter

**Next quarter EPS guidance:** $0.38 - $0.52

**Next quarter revenue guidance:** $6.40 - $6.80 Bn

Compared to other semi stocks, MU is an absolute bargain at this price...

What Musk predicted for Tesla, about their market cap higher than Apple and Saudi Aramco combined, it seems more likely to happen to Nvidia. 

Jensen in his capacity as CEO is not paid billions in salary, so not sure how he keeps himself motivated, constantly creating value for NVDA’s shareholders. He also owns less than 10% of Nvidia shares, and he is not worried of losing control of the company, and asking board for a big pay package. 

In my opinion, if anyone in the world deserves a US$50b pay package, it is Jensen.

The technology powered by Nvidia chips is going to be felt through many industries, across many countries.

FOMC meeting will be a dud for 0dtes,"Necessary to post this since I see hundreds of chalkheads in the daily thread wanting to 0dte for FOMC meeting today. If you pay any attention to the recent data and do any reading at all, you know that the following is likely:

**Wall Street already priced in interest rate cuts being delayed until further this year after the recent CPI and PPI data release. Interest rates widely expected to hold at 5.25% for the FIFTH time.**

If you pull up the SPY chart on Robinhood (It’s the only broker that lets rigards like you play w/ options) and look at when the last meeting was on 1/31, you’ll see that:

1. JPOW had the same sentiment at the last meeting that he will most likely have today aka WAIT AND see (no cuts or raises in the near future)
2. SPY DUMPED 🟥  before pumping to $500 the next week. 

The best move is to listen to what JPOW says, and play long for the following month. If you can’t afford long term options, check out spread options. 

**TL;DR: Don’t FOMO into the meeting and buy 0dtes bc the bots are doing it. I know how desperate some of you regards are, but it’s not worth taking that $6k loan on your credit card to lose it in 5 minutes. Most likely the meeting will move the market sideways or move in a way that will lose you money (Theta decay).**

UPDATE: SPY hit over $518 so congrats if you made some money, but now it’s coming down so I wasn’t entirely wrong. Any regards who hopped into meetings and held are probably fucked. 

**UPDATE 2: DAMNNNN I WAS HELLA WRONG, CHALKHEAD DEGENS ARE WAY SMARTER THAN ME, don’t listen to me ever again**

UPDATE 3: I took my own advice and did not FOMO into SPY calls/puts today. Missed out on some big wins, but you can’t catch ‘em all.

M&T Bank 40% of the C&I and CRE Portfolio Has not Been Examined,"[The Criticized C&I and CRE (dogshit) Loans slide here](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/36270/000095017024005179/mtb-ex99_1.htm) shows that only about 60% of criticized loans have been reviewed, leaving a notable 40% unexamined.

While this data point alone doesn't necessarily indicate impending bank failure, it does introduce some uncertainty about the true credit quality of M&T's loan portfolio. Without a comprehensive assessment of that remaining 40%, it's difficult to rule out the possibility that some of those loans may be at higher risk of default than currently recognized.

Thorough and timely loan reviews are an important risk management practice. If a meaningful portion of the portfolio is overdue for reevaluation, especially in economically sensitive sectors like CRE, it could suggest some weakness in credit risk oversight. It could also suggest that they are trying to obscure even more weaknesses in their portfolio than their underwater HTM treasuries.

I'm not smart, but I am pretty sure a collapse and then a bank run is coming to M&T Bank. I am curious to learn from others who actually know what all this stuff means. Please help me b/c I'm going short.

Is Vertiv (VRT) a Good Growth Story Because They Have Water Cooling Solved - instead of the other guy,"It's Not a DD but a discussion and wondering if anyone has been following them closely.

Jensen specifically mentioned Vertiv in his [GTC analysis talk](https://video.ibm.com/recorded/133431763) which was amazing btw. It was like a bonus earnings call.

* In [2023 Vertiv was up 269%](https://www.forbes.com/sites/petercohan/2023/12/31/up-269-in-2023-vertiv-stock-could-outperform-nvidia-shares-in-2024/?sh=6c9ed3ec5e78)
* It's American based in Westerville, Ohio
* In the field of Generative AI they are the only other company other than Nvidia that went up 200% in 2023
* Jensen said at GTC that we are going to need bigger GPU's and more and more data centers - this seems to be the rack that Nvidia prefers and is using rather than SCMI
* If you're installing the racks you're also installing the networking for those NVLINK connections of 600 GPU's running as 1 giant GPU
* In December 2023 they announced they would provide cooling to Intel's Gaudi AI accelerator
* Joe Biden, Raimondo and J Pow just gave Intel 8.5 billion in funding just because America (it's a national security issue)
   * Production of Chips needs to come home
* Because their providing the racks that have water the racks also need power and they have collaborated with American Electric AEP Power to implement the microgrid application.
   * They're providing the diesel generator backups for disaster recovery in that microgrid application
* Generative AI is going to need more water cooling.
* Sam Altman said Chips are the new currency
* Vertiv Dominates the industry - 2023 they posted better than expected results with an ambition forecast for the year
   * Earnings per share grew 126% in Q3
* SMCI seems played out
* They have a chart that looks like this

DD: Multiple reasons why Reddit will actually go up post-IPO,"Everyone is saying ""I cannot wait to short Reddit"" but if you look at the large picture many things are working in Reddit's favor to have a successful IPO. 

**1. Banks and Exchanges want a successful high-profile IPO.**

Only 151 companies went public last year. This is down significantly from 2021 when there were 1,035. 
Part of the reason for the decline is many high-profile companies that quickly fell below their IPO levels like Instacart. Investment banks make money by partnering with companies in the IPO process; Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, J.P.Morgan and Bank of America Securities are the lead underwriters for Reddit.



**2. Limited institutional interest in shorting the stock**

Very few funds or institutions are going to short the stock. As I mentioned investment banks want more IPOs so why would they short Reddit and potentially cause more companies to stay private? Additionally, after the short-squeeze that happened with Game S no fund is going to risk shorting Reddit. The risk of being burned is too high for the possible reward. Also, because Reddit is so new there are no swaps or other complex instruments available, the only way to short would be actual short-selling. Bill Ackman ran into this same issue with herbalife and got burned.

**3. Options will not be available immediately and the exchange has discretion on when to allow them.** 

Going back to my first point. The NYSE has an interest in the IPO going well. They know options will increase volatility so they will wait as long as possible before allowing options to be traded. Options are the only way 99% of retial investors can go short on a stock. Obviously, you could actually short-sell the stock but the average retail investor will not and it's not even possible on Robinhood. 

****


As I am writing this it was just announced because of strong demand the IPO will be at the top of the IPO range ($34) . Another reason Reddit will have a strong IPO.

How Nvidia misled you about the B200 (and why AMD's MI300X will still sell),"Hi, me again. I gave you the AMD DD yesterday ([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1biqt1k/dd\_i\_ddd\_the\_nvidia\_run\_up\_last\_year\_250700\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1biqt1k/dd_i_ddd_the_nvidia_run_up_last_year_250700_and/)). I liked reading all the insight from people smarter than me and the regardation in the comments, thank you for that. **I'm here today to talk about the B200 because it came up a lot. What I'm going to show is that AMD will still sell a lot of MI300Xs even when it comes out.**

First let me say the B200 is great and will be the leader, and will sell a gazillions. However, for whatever reason Nvidia decided to make their stats and metrics highly misleading in their announcement, especially for laymen who don't know what the fuck they are looking at and just see big numbers and monkey brain instincts kick in. The B200 and GB200 do have a sizeable lead on the MI300X, but its not 4x or 1000x or whatever I was seeing in the comments. **The raw performance difference from MI300X to B200 is 90% for FLOPs and 51% for memory bandwidth. The B200 has 36% more transistors than the MI300X, so it is simply a larger chip (by transistor) and that accounts for a lot of the difference. AMD can scale their next chip up if they want more FLOPs and memory bandwidth too.**

Basically the issues with Nvidia's announcement boil down to 1) not revealing their methodology, 2) doing apples to oranges comparisons, and 3) giving metrics that are intentionally misleading so people watching do apples to oranges comparisons.

I'm not going to cover everything, but I will just give a quick rundown of how I got to my numbers. We are going to use these two pages:

[https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/gb200-nvl72/](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/gb200-nvl72/)

[https://www.amd.com/en/products/accelerators/instinct/mi300/mi300x.html](https://www.amd.com/en/products/accelerators/instinct/mi300/mi300x.html)

First lets define what we are talking about.

**MI300X**

The MI300X is basically like a giant GPU. Up to 8 of them fit in a big computer that goes in a rack in a datacenter. They are connected to the server using PCIE like your graphics card, but are also interconnected with each other using Infinity Fabric cables. Infinity Fabric is important because it allows the cards to bypass the CPU when transferring data from one card to another. AMD's metrics are for one card.

**GB200**

The GB200 is a giant two-rack computer. It is made up of 72 individual graphics cards and 36 CPUs. Nvidia's version of Infinity Fabric is called NVLink, and all of the 72 GPUs and 36 CPUs are all connected to one another using NVLink. This is the largest interconnection of its kind, which is the impressive part of the GB200. Nvlink also can connect multiple GB200s together so all of their GPUs can talk with one another. **This scale of Nvlink is really the killer app of the GB200, not the chips.** 

In Nvidia's marketing material, it shows metrics for one whole GB200 system and also for one GB200 ""superchip"" which includes 2 GPUs and a CPU. Superchip is intentionally misleading though, because its 3 separate chips on a board (and one is a CPU), not one big chip.

[2x GB200 \\""superchips\\"" each with 2 GPUs and 1 CPU](https://preview.redd.it/p7tbzgfz4jpc1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=532d5df2b4c2e87d88a4415d7d52aeec7d3a4474)

**B200**

The B200 is a single giant GPU. Its probably something like what each of the GPUs on the ""superchips"" are, but we don't know for sure. Either way its a single chip like the MI300X. I'm going to call the GPUs on the superchips B200s for simplicity sake.

# Nvidia's Long Green Dick Bar Charts

I've looked through all of these, and they are all almost completely meaningless other than as trend indicators. They don't tell you even what metrics are being shown other than a two word description. Forget testing methodologies and all the details needed to understand them. I can tell you that the massive NVLink setup in the GB200 is going to lead to huge efficiency and clustering improvements, but on an individual chip basis, there is not as big of a difference between the B200 and the H200 or MI300X other than size.

# Comparing apples-to-apples

The MI300X's specs are plainly available, but nvidia hasn't released all of them for the B200 yet. Nvidia does give us 10 PFLOPs per ""superchip"" of 16 bit floating point with sparsity (this is a common type of number for AI) and AMD gives us 2.61 PFLOPs per card.

https://preview.redd.it/ujbwkv675jpc1.png?width=941&format=png&auto=webp&s=56864fb260223e857a5ee840de9513cb4c1f8d5a

Remember, the ""superchip"" is actually 3 chips on a board: a CPU and two GPUs. The CPU on the GB200 superchip is probably providing a minuscule amount of FP16 compared to the GPUs, so we can just divide the number by 2 to get 5. **So that's the best metric we can get right now: 2.61 AMD vs 5 Nvidia (FP16 PFLOPs w/ sparsity) or 90% more.**

# Memory Bandwidth

For LLM inference, or what happens when you type ""tldr this wsb post:"" into chatgpt, memory bandwidth is the most important bottleneck. Nvidia gives us a comparable figure for this: 16 TB/s for 2 GPUs or 8 TB/s per B200. The MI300X has 5.3 TB/s of memory bandwidth, **so the B200 is running with 51% more memory bandwidth.**

# Yes its good, but not out of this world

The new nvidia chips coming out later this year are a solid generational move and will be great for customers. **However there is no magic, and most of their per-chip performance increase from previous nvidia chips is because they are a lot larger. The H100 and H200 are 80B transistors, the MI300X is 153B transistors, and this new B200 is 208B transistors.** There is no magic with the new B200 other than it is a lot bigger in terms of transistor count and has slightly smaller more efficient transistors.

**The real killer app of the B200 is the way it can be combined with hundreds or thousands of other B200s using NVLink. AMD does have Infinity Fabric which connects 8 GPUs, but they haven't done this scale of integration yet. However its a reasonable assumption AMD can scale Infinity Link in the same way, so this isn't putting AMD out of the question for its next generation.**

# Where does the MI300X fit in?

Read my other post for more details about the AMD value proposition, but I'll do a quick summary here. **Remember that the MI300X is probably currently the leader in performance and will be until the B200 comes out. That gives it 9 months give or take at the top.** However, it does not need to remain the leader to sell in a volume that will be a huge increase in revenue and profit for AMD. There are plenty of niches that the MI300X does fill that the B200 doesn't. For instance the MI300X does have over double the 64 bit floating point performance of the B200. 64 bit floats are used in scientific modelling but not in AI. Presumably Nvidia will release another card that competes for general compute performance, but the MI300X does both AI and large scale compute well. Also for smaller deployments that can't leverage NVLink's large scaling efficiencies, the MI300X can easily make sense. The MI300X does have a similar interconnect at 8-card scale with Infinity Fabric. Also its likely companies will pick up the MI300X simply to diversify so Nvidia doesn't have negotiating leverage on them or because they want to reduce supply chain risk. Lastly AMD can always drop the price and still have a huge profit margin. **Its easy for me to imagine a 15% AMD AI accelerator market share with the B200 existing for these reasons.**

Furthermore, none of the additions from the GB200 or B200 are serious moats for Nvidia that AMD can't cross. **AMD can scale up its chip transistor counts, add more stacks of HBM, and scale Infinity Link in the same way. The GB200 is great, but it does not represent a hurdle AMD can't cross.**",wallstreetbets,https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bjkrtt/how_nvidia_misled_you_about_the_b200_and_why_amds/,2024-03-20 14:37:00,0.15574008191355135,0.48040670780466693,0.041,0.093,0.9968

Nothing is Making Sense with ARM Anymore,"&#x200B;

So the sell-off that everyone expected did not happen in Mar 12. I thought the whole point of going public is to sell some stocks of the company to raise capital. It's hard to believe they will hold onto 90% of the stock even after the lock up, unless it has always been to plan to make only 10% of the company public tradable. Even they sell a small percentage of what they are holding, say 10% more, it will cause the available stocks on the market to double.

I can think of a few reasons why Softbank should sell. But they might be just wishful thinking from my part.

1. Keep in mind that Softbank does not benefit from the current stock price until they actually sell, because the current free float was sold to the market at IPO price.
2. PE too high. 1600 ttm, 100 forward. Are you kidding me? (inb4 ""PE does not matter in AI stocks"")
3. There are better AI stocks out there. Why would someone hold ARM over NVDA?

DD: I DD'd the nvidia run up last year ($250->$700) and was right. Now I have a new prediction,"Here's my nvidia DD from last year (NVDA was $250 and I predicted $700 within a year): [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/13lb98n/dd\_nvda\_to\_700\_by\_this\_time\_next\_year/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/13lb98n/dd_nvda_to_700_by_this_time_next_year/)

Last week I timed the exit on my BTC and QQQ holdings fairly well. **Now I'm setting my sights on a new horizon: AMD**

AMD is sort of like the nice ugly step sister of hot bae nvidia. Everyone ""likes"" her, but she doesn't get invited to parties and no one takes her seriously. Right now reminds me of Ryzen 1. When AMD was $12, I predicted AMD's stock price would triple in the next two years due to how well the architecture fit with datacenter needs. I posted my DD here and was right. It took most people by surprise because at the time Intel had 99% of the datacenter CPU market. Now we look at $180+ AMD price. I think we are once again going to be surprised by su bae and co.

I'll get to my evidence that AMD will exceed expectations yet again, but first I want to address some obvious points of skepticism.

1. **Firstly AMD's seemingly absurd P/E ratio of 364:** I'm going to show that not only is AMD's revenue going to go up by an absurd amount in the next year, but also its net income margin. Nvidia operates at around 50% income right now and AMD is operating at around 20% right now. That gap is going to close considerably in the next year. I'm estimating AMD will reach around 35-40% net income. On top of that AMD will grow revenue by 50% in the next year (wishful thinking would say as high as 70% more revenue) exclusively due to AI accelerators. This will all lead to considerably more realistic P/E ratio.
2. **Next Nvidia's control on the market:** The evidence points to this being a detriment to Nvidia. AI companies are looking to diversify from Nvidia because they don't want to be vendor-locked, Nvidia has a 1 year back order on its top AI accelerators, and Nvidia's massive profit margin makes it easy to undercut their price. Furthermore, CUDA dominance is highly exaggerated today. I use this stuff every day, and ROCm is absolutely production ready, especially for large companies who have the staff to optimize for it. The people who say ROCm sucks haven't used it in a while -- AMD is working on it at a break neck pace.

# Now on to my DD

The debate about AMD's price largely boils down to its newest AI accelerator's value (the MI300X) versus Nvidia's current AI accelerator (the H100). AI accelerators are now most of the accelerator market (including GPUs), and also have the highest profit margins by far, so they are basically 80% of the valuation on these companies' stock prices. Yes the H200 and the new GB200 are coming out soon for Nvidia, but the MI300X has a timing lead on them which enables it to get some foothold. So for the moment, its MI300X vs H100 for companies deciding what to buy.

**Accelerator Value:** Reviews for the MI300X are going to come out imminently (within a few weeks), and we will begin seeing hard evidence for its value proposition then. I have spent a lot of time on older AMD cards analyzing their performance versus big green. My findings are that generally AMD is capable of being as fast or faster than Nvidia, but most open source projects are optimized better for Nvidia so in the real world AMD has a performance disadvantage. However in the case of the MI300X, its raw performance is so large over an H100, it will likely produce slightly better real world performance. Also the MI300X is selling for around $25k per card (you can buy it right now [https://www.thinkmate.com/system/a+-server-8125gs-tnmr2](https://www.thinkmate.com/system/a+-server-8125gs-tnmr2)) where the H100 is around $40k, so companies will be looking at benchmarks in a couple weeks that point to the MI300X being slightly faster and considerably less expensive.

**Nvidia supply constraint:** Nvidia has a back order of around a year for their latest AI accelerators. This means if a company needs to immediately purchase accelerators for a new project, they simply can't from Nvidia at scale. AMD's order books are currently open, but probably filling fast for this reason.

**Announced customers:** Meta is going to be the largest customer for the MI300X. They have indirectly announced that they will purchase up to almost half of their 600k accelerators this year from AMD ([https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/02/meta\_ai\_chips/](https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/02/meta_ai_chips/)). This customer alone will add 25% to AMD's revenue and improve their profit margin from 20% to roughly 28%. MS has already started deploying the MI300X on Azure and Oracle has announced they will launch VMs with them, but neither has announced numbers. Who won't be using AMD? OpenAI has a multi-year contract with nvidia, and Google uses their own proprietary TPU.

**AI accelerator headwind:** The AI accelerator market is expected to have a CAGR of over 20% for the next 5+ years. This means there will be continued supply constraints that incentivize diversifying hardware. New players inherently have an advantage because of this. It just happens that AMD is the next new player to be mature and scaled enough for widespread adoption. Yes Intel and startups will probably do fine also, but AMD is seeing ridiculous growth at this very moment that hasn't appeared on their earnings report yet (fulfillment for the MI300X did not ramp up until roughly January). There is such a ridiculous amount of demand in this ai accelerator market that everyone in it will grow.

# My price target: $450 AMD

After doing some napkin math on the market, I think it is reasonable for AMD to acquire 15-20% of the AI accelerator market by the end of the year, up from an inconsequential market share before. This includes speculation about AMD's product competitiveness, their ability to scale, the customers that will be interested in buying AMD, market growth, and new Nvidia product launches. Extrapolating that marketshare into net income by using a rough margin per card and using Nvidia's P/E ratio as a baseline model, translates to an AMD fair stock price of around $450 by the end of the year.

AMD's price will start to go up after the MI300X reviews come out and rumors of their customer acquisitions come in. The May earnings report will be where it starts to appear on their books, but they are still ramping up right now and Q2 is where we will see the largest earnings growth.

**My positions are: $190 6/21C and $200 10/18C**

"These calls could be 500 Baggers. Turn $1,000 into $500,000","Okay, I already know I'm gonna get a bunch of hate for this post, so I only ask that you read the entire  post  before replying. I honestly think this could be the biggest trading opportunity since Jan 2021.

In October 2021 $DWAC announced they were gonna merge with a brand new Donald Trump Media Company called Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG). It's not just Truth Social but an entire company that will have paid video streaming, etc. Traders went crazy and the price shot up 1700% to $175. Then the SEC opened a lawsuit against them trying to block the merger and the stock crashed. After almost 3 years, the SEC finally cleared all the lawsuits and approved the merger. **$DWAC is holding a shareholder meeting on Friday, March 22nd to vote to approve the business combination. If the vote passes, the stock will change to ticker symbol $DJT on Monday, March 25th and make its public debut on the NASDAQ.**

**MAGA people are crazy.** When Donald Trump announced Trump NFTs they sold out within minutes. When he launched those Trump shoes they also sold out within minutes and are now selling for 10k+. 99% of the general public has NO IDEA a brand new Trump stock $DJT is going to be making its debut on Monday. Imagine Trump ringing the bell to the NYSE and pumping $DJT. And every news outlet in America covering it. Do you honestly think the MAGA people won't dump their entire 401ks, IRAs, etc and put everything into $DJT?

The daily volume right now is basically nothing, and when this gets mass media coverage when it turns into $DJT it may explode. And if you think Trump (who is gonna own most of it) is gonna dump his shares on everyone....he probably will....but there's a 6 month lock-up period. That means no insiders, including Trump, can sell any shares until 6 months of $DJT going public. It also has a 200% borrow rate going into the merger meaning any inflow of volume will make for a giant move.

Most new companies that go public don't have weekly options or any options at all. When Grindr went public it shot up 900% on the first day. A stock tied to Donald Trump Jr shot up 300% on merger day just because of Trump Jrs name. Yes they sold off later on but this is a trade not a long-term investment. $DWAC has weekly options because it's been around so long. All it takes is $DWAC going slightly above the old ATH and you can turn $1,000 into $500,000 with far OTM $90 calls. **This would be the best trade since Jan 2021. All it takes is volume coming from nationwide media coverage and MAGA cult buying and the trade will work.**

Here are my positions: March 28th $50, $60, $70, $80 and $85 calls -

"The Intel DD you need, but not deserve (Part 3)"," Alright, so apparently there is still the need to clear some things up. Since many of you really despise reading, I will try to make it shorter this time.

*“BbUt wHaT AbOuT NvDa, AmD, TsM, etC”*

It is kind of embarrassing that I have to actually point this out, but yeah: just because I make the case for one company, it does not necessarily imply statements about any other company. As I pointed out in my first DD ( [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/CnOvwpbRi8](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/CnOvwpbRi8) ), the currency of the future is compute and I expect all of them to do well. Growth and cooperation are not zero sum games. However, I specifically wanted to talk about Intel being undervalued, so please refrain from trying to shove that “bUt TsM LEEDA” up my ass, as I want to keep the available space in my anus for the inevitable green INTC dildo.

*“InTeL jUsT suRvIves oN wElFarE”*  
The West wants to get back into semiconductor manufacturing, but the cost of manufacturing is cheaper in Asia. Now, every company that tries to set this up without government subsidies is at an immediate disadvantage in a global market and that needs to be compensated. This is quite easy to understand, but I’ll make it even easier: if you blow someone behind the dumpster, but the Asian dude next to you is blowing cheaper, the US government has to pay you a little extra if it wants you to keep blowing and thus prevent a blowjob-drought if Winnie the Pooh decides do withdraw his guy.

&#x200B;

Now to your most pressing issue: 

*“wHy sToCk NoT gO uP”:*

First, to all those with 0dtes, I am not even going to comment on this. There is a reason I went with shares.

Second, to all the whining paperhands:

Think about markets and who makes money in them. The US hedge fund industry makes about 200+ billion in profit a year. So, if they are not JPow who can just ejaculate 200 billion out of nothing, you might wonder where the money comes from. Does it come from their competitors who all have the same pile of Harvard jackasses for “money making”, or could it be from someone else?

  
For your convenience, I am going to cite one of them: *“From there, the only thing we have to do to use the great machine \[the market\] to take money out of other people’s pockets and give it to us, is to be better at valuation than anyone else. When they make mistakes in estimating future probability, we make money.”*  So yes, surprise surprise, success in the market is about predicting probabilities of risk/reward ratios. If you were able to read and do proper DD you’d find out that Intel has low risk due to its immense geopolitical importance and high potential reward if they can pull Gelsinger’s plan off ([https://www.techfund.one/p/intels-fall-and-gelsingers-master](https://www.techfund.one/p/intels-fall-and-gelsingers-master)). And now, you might ask yourself who is going to make money from this very beneficial ratio. 

To make the money, you need to buy and sell at some point. This is not easy for big financial institutions, as the volume that they have to buy will inevitably influence the price. For that, they have a nasty trick up their sleeves: volume and algorithms to drive stock prices. Using “free” Robinhood you serve them your order flow on a silver plate, so they know exactly what and when you are buying and selling. “Omg good upside for Intel and the stock is down, wtffff this market is so confusing yada yada I need to sell yada yada”. It is supposed to be confusing, there is no free lunch. The best time to buy is when it hurts the most, ask yourself how often you would have made a profit if you didn’t sell at your most hurtful point. And that’s where the 200 billion comes in: by using stock price to deflect your estimation of the risk/reward ratio (which may even have been correct in the beginning) to greatly influence your market decisions in their favor. So for all the people that ask “wHeN StoNk gO uP”: I can’t tell you the exact date, but I would assume as soon as the last pig has sold its position and the big boys are set. 

Tldr; the next time you use your paperhands to pull the trigger on your RH and subsequently write a whiny comment, remember: don’t get slaughtered.

Cheers

NVDA will drop to 840 tomorrow,"1. The FOMC meeting is going to be extremely hawkish. No rate cut is coming until August at the earliest and this is due to the insane inflation we’re seeing both in the states and globally. Japan for the first time in 17 years has raised interest rates which will no doubt raise the cost of goods imported here, making inflation even worse domestically. This is a clear pattern we are seeing globally that will impact prices paid in the US

2. The market has lost enthusiasm for NVDIA in the current economic climate. They had one of the most stellar conferences where they announced they have their hands in every industry, where Wall Street had even raised price targets on them, and what happens? Everyone dumped the stock due to fears stemming from the FOMC meeting. Right now the market is pricing in 3 rate cuts but that just isn’t possible with the rate of inflation we are at right now. The entire market will tank tomorrow once retail pulls their head out of their behinds and acknowledges the facts 

3. I bought calls

4. Even with all the good news it’s still months away from actually generating revenue for NVDIA.

Is Gigacloud Technology (NASDAQ: GCT) A Scam?,"I did a DD for this company last week here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bazhkv/gct\_is\_set\_to\_take\_off\_with\_earnings\_next\_week/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bazhkv/gct_is_set_to_take_off_with_earnings_next_week/)

 Today I sold all my shares. 

Long story short they missed the deadline for their 10-K after annoucning a too good to be true looking earnings result on friday which wouldn't alone have been too sus however the founder and insiders have since dumped a lot of shares in past 2 days and the market has been spooked. 

 I want to believe their numbers but I think my best assessment is this: I fucked up. Even if the numbers gets audited and it comes out okay it's not in the clear. I watched 'The China Hustle' documentary and even if KPMG China (their auditor which is not KPMG but rather a Chinese subsidiary) gives them a rubber stamp like they have done before for chinese fraud companies it will not prove anything.  [https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1H60E9/#:\~:text=BEIJING%20(Reuters)%20%2D%20Global%20accounting,out%20of%20over%20%24400%20million](https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1H60E9/#:~:text=BEIJING%20(Reuters)%20%2D%20Global%20accounting,out%20of%20over%20%24400%20million).

If legit  it's currently one of if not the most insanely undervalued company in the world and yet their founders sold shares knowing full well the operations of the company.  There are two likely scenarios , something I don't want to say for the remote possibility of a defamation lawsuit or even they do not believe or trust their own numbers. 

I have likely been duped and am just breaking after a large gain since I initially purchased 7 weeks ago but put more at the peak the day the earnings report was released.  A guy I have been talking to who was up more on this stock 400% on Friday also sold their entire position after they pulled this stunt. I may have missed out on a rocket trip but Gigacloud has lost my trust. Stable bluechips like TSM it is from now on.

DD: RDDT Valuation Model,"  

Sup regards, 

We are under a day away from finding out whether RDDT’s IPO will ride to the moon or drill to the center of the earth. As a loser (winner?) who didn’t have enough karma to get an allocation, I’m sitting this one out. 

Right now, there are pretty compelling qualitative arguments for why the IPO will go well or poorly. The second that you think one narrative is going to get the upper hand, something from the other side pops out and makes you wonder again (such as Bloomberg saying the IPO is guiding to price at the top of its range). 

To pass the time, I thought I would run a valuation model today to throw some quant in the mix. 

I’m going to do a base-case FCF build, then play around with some bull and bear stuff. 

***Assumptions:*** 

Rf: 4.3%

Reddit Beta: unknown, but I’m going with 1.5, which I think is generous and will be higher (Meta is 1.2, pinterest is 1, and Bumble is 1.7). 

Discount rate: 11.8% (derived through CAPM, with market risk premium of 5%)

G rate: 3% (again, I’m being generous here, but you can check my sensitivity tables) 

FCF Build, base case (literally just what the analysts built ripped from S-1 and reasonable expectations) 

TLDR: not looking good, still negative (207.5) in FY 28. Wild to have an adjusted EBITDA number that is still negative, fuck. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cvnzork6iipc1.png?width=998&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d2014bd4e953176556fd3e7f1f3ab75359a7d48

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/uq88s108iipc1.png?width=627&format=png&auto=webp&s=38a46f37ed6babf8bc31643dfa3ef0899963a816

Oof, negative share price. Need to up that FCF cash money Spez. Obviously they won’t have a negative share price, but this leads the more discerning regard to wonder if they are trying to make him or her into a bagholder with this IPO. 

***Bull DCF Scenario*** 

Now let’s say that some AMAZING things happen to reddit instead. Revenue growth for this two decade old app accelerate to 25% YoY now through 2028, adjusted EBITDA margins expand to about half of what Meta has by 2028 (again, super rosy), and Beta comes in cooler than I thought driving the discount rate down to 11%: 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xz4ercb9iipc1.png?width=1090&format=png&auto=webp&s=baed9563e2271852e53afed5a64a34561b05bf90

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zaj8p83aiipc1.png?width=532&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d07f0b5b6b169791077adb490e1010a558a8a15

Even with this very positive bull case, the projected price is only $12.71, representing a discount of (60.9%)- nice- to the estimation of the offer price. 

The base case is so bearish that there is no point making a more bearish case than having a negative share price. 

***Bull Base Exit Multiple Method:*** 

This speaks mostly for itself, and helps to show us more of the upside if this stock starts to pump due to inflated multiple/ market mania, but still lots of downside valuation pressure. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/j3ev0g3biipc1.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=546d2deb07cfd01952e72426f9d3a29a467ce0bd

***Quick and Dirty Comp Valuation:***

Since revenue is the only thing of RDDT’s that is positive, the only sensical multiple is TEV/Rev. Based on a comp set of Meta, Pinterst, and Snap, the Hi/Lo for this is 42.2 and 7.3. 

&#x200B;

***Conclusion, TL;DR:*** 

IMO, this opinion depends on the regard energy on opening day. I do like the inverse WSB theory here since most are so bearish, but in my nuts I feel like it will pop and then bleed much like HOOD did. I’m not dumb enough to short a meme stock, but given the quant valuations, lack of lockup period, and shaky market, this is a no from me dog. On the other hand, if we drop to teens/ low teens, I could be very persuaded by some delicious FDs or LEAPs.

Managing risk should be NORMAL,"I don't mean this to come off preachy. I myself have lived a life of stock market sin, but I've come to the light and I want others to see the truth as well. 

In this sub we have come to glorify massive gains and colossal losses 📉.  The typical person here would seem to have a 5-10k dollar Robinhood account, which they eagerly are willing to risk most of on a random earnings event, overnighting weeklies, or dca-ing 0dte against the market until their account reaches -99%. 

What if it didn't have to be this way? What if someone with a 5-10k cash account could average 100-200 bucks a day in gains rather than just going all or nothing? They would only take 25-100 trading days to double up with a more measured approach to trading. 

How? Well, how about for starters: 

1) Weeklies and 0dte are for scalping, not swinging. Yes, when you see COIN or NVDA or whatever the fuck stock you suck yourself off to has a good setup on the intraday: you scalp that shit. You buy a weekly and sit there until you've made a little money and you throw the option back into the sea 🌊 after like 10-30 minutes.  



2) Swinging has a clean technical setup. So, say we want to enter a trade against QQQ in this bull market. The trend is already against it. Would it make more sense to enter short if it was stalling out at like 445 where you would have a closer logical stop, or 434 where you're just jerking yourself off hoping the last 6 months of trend support will break? Praise God. 👏  



3) You can accept a loss and you know where you'll take it when you enter a trade. A general rule I've learned in the futures trading community is you never will let a single day take out more than 3 days of your average gains. Preferably less, but we are in the business of risking it for the biscuit so sometimes shit happens. Say you made 200 for the last 5 days, and the next day you get fucked for 600, you're still up 400 and your mental has probably taken a hit but it's better than if you took your account from 5k to 12k overnight then toileted the entire account dca-ing spy puts against an uptrend day. Then you just won't be feeling good about shit for a couple months rather than a day or two.

PLNT - Planet Fitness. Fast turn around opportunity?,"Planet Fitness is a gym chain known for its affordable memberships and its focus on creating a non-intimidating atmosphere for gym-goers. Here's a breakdown of some key points:

**Membership:**

* They offer two tiers of memberships: Classic and PF Black Card®.
* Classic memberships start around $10 a month and grant access to your home club. (This is the biggest draw, affordability)
* PF Black Card® memberships typically cost around $24.99 a month and come with additional perks like access to any Planet Fitness location, the ability to bring a guest, and access to premium digital workouts.

**Focus:**

* Planet Fitness promotes a budget-conscious product. It is super important in this economy where the costs of everything have gone up.
* They offer cardio and strength training equipment but tend to have less heavy machinery compared to some other gyms.
* Some locations include tanning beds and massage chairs with memberships.

**Other considerations:**

* Planet Fitness has been in the news recently due to a controversy regarding locker room access for transgender individuals \[Daily Mail\]. This may be a factor to consider depending on your values. (The dip in the stock price was similar to Budweiser, but I don't see this being a major contributing factor to people canceling an already dirt-cheap membership.)
* **Institutional Ownership : 112.17%**
* **Short Interest: 5.34%\*** (This seems out of date given that so many more shares are owned\*)

Here are some resources to learn more about Planet Fitness:

* Planet Fitness website: [https://www.planetfitness.com/](https://www.planetfitness.com/)
* Planet Fitness app: [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/planet-fitness-workouts/id399857015](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/planet-fitness-workouts/id399857015)

**My Thesis:**

The recent dip was a one-off fear-driven event, and I don't expect any Twitter barrage to have any lasting impact on the brand. This is not Budweiser where you have to go to the store spend money on them and walk out with the box. This is a gym that has historically sticky memberships. Especially when they only cost $10. That expense is an after-thought. 

**Position:** $60 calls for May

"AMA Announcement: Unveiling the Future of Decentralized AI and Software Development with Tau Net ($AGRS) - March 25th, 6pm UTC - 1500 USDT Giveaway"," Greetings, r/Cryptocurrency community!

We're thrilled to announce that the Tau Net team will be hosting an AMA session right here on **March 25th at 6pm UTC**. This is your chance to dive deep into the innovative world of Tau Net & Agoras ($AGRS), a project at the forefront of reshaping how we conceive software development and decentralized AI.

**1500 USDT Giveaway**

To make this AMA extra special, we're giving away **1500 USDT** to the top 15 questions (100 USDT each). Share your most insightful, curious, or inspiring questions for a chance to win.

**Who We Are**

We are Tau (www.tau.net), a ten year old software company pioneering **logical AI** software development. We’ve developed a novel formal specification language, called Tau Language, intended for precise and accurate development of mission critical systems and complex software. Our novel use of formal specification enables **correct-by-construction software development**, thereby eliminating many of the problems that software development and machine learning AI still face, e.g. bugs, traditional testing costs, hefty maintenance, AI hallucination and many technical barriers to participation in development, ultimately enabling anyone to be a developer.

**What is Tau Net**

Tau Net is a decentralized blockchain network fully controlled, governed and developed by its entire user base in a sound manner. By allowing all users to write information in its system e.g. human knowledge, personal opinions and desired behavior for the system to function in logical sentences that work as formal specifications, these sentences are directly executable and thereby function as working software. Tau Net logically reasons over the collective requirements given by its users and detects the agreement on how they want it to function, and puts its own next version as the next block in its blockchain, evolving from block to block, resulting in rapid collaborative development.

**Agoras: Currency of Tau**

Agoras is the currency of Tau Net. $AGRS pioneers in facilitating the exchange of knowledge, computational assets, and derivatives within the Tau Net ecosystem. Uniquely, $AGRS stands as the world’s first token with user-controlled tokenomics. Users describe in logical sentences how they want $AGRS to be like and Tau Net automatically detects and implements the agreement as executable software, empowers Tau Net’s users to effortlessly modify the tokenomics, simply by voicing their desired specification.

**What are our breakthroughs?**

NVIDIA’s CEO shares a vision similar to our future of Software and AI ([https://x.com/Carnage4Life/status/1761483377365152234?s=20](https://x.com/Carnage4Life/status/1761483377365152234?s=20)).

Tau Net introduces the concept of ""Software as Sentences."" This is a new method of developing software, utilizing executable formal specifications, different from code and typical machine learning e.g. ChatGPT. It enables users to describe how they want the network to be like in logical sentences. These logical sentences are processed and understood by the network and directly executable as software, accurate according to the description. Agoras ($AGRS) leverages this technology to allow user-controlled tokenomics, and a decentralized marketplace for knowledge, derivatives, and computational resources.

**Redefining AI: Logic-based AI vs. ML-based AI**

Today’s most popular AI applications (ChatGPT, Bard, etc) rely on machine learning, a probabilistic approach which is unable to guarantee accurate results. Contrarily, Tau Net employs logic-based AI, thereby being able to handle logical reasoning and deduce new facts from given knowledge, all while guaranteeing that the result is completely accurate according to knowledge provided. In addition, Tau Net is also able to explain to the user how it arrived at a result. Therefore, Tau Net is superior in its reasoning capabilities compared to machine learning based alternatives. By offering formal proofs of correctness, it addresses a pivotal challenge in the AI domain achieving absolute certainty in outcomes.

**User-Controlled Software and AI Governance**

On Tau Net, users are granted unprecedented control over the network. Tau Net provides an effective solution to the AI alignment problem by enabling users to define rules or embed regulations directly within its software. These rules are adhered to with proof, even after any future updates. It possesses the unique capability to automatically reject any attempts at tampering with its software, especially if such attempts aim to introduce undesired behavior. For instance, if the command ""Never send private data over the network"" is embedded, Tau Net will consistently honor this rule, automatically rejecting any future updates that contravene it. This level of software integrity and compliance is unparalleled in the technology domain and important to ensure system integrity.

**Unlocking AGI: Collective Intelligence and Combined Brainpower on Tau Net**

On Tau Net, collective intelligence emerges as users input their knowledge via descriptions in logical sentences enabled by Tau Language. Tau Net is able to reason over given knowledge, as well as combining knowledge and thereby deducing new enlightening facts and groundbreaking discoveries. Every piece of knowledge becomes maximally useful, lying dormant until connected with another fact, potentially yielding solutions to some of the world's biggest problems. This synergy propels Tau Net on the fastest path towards realizing AGI, marking a pivotal shift in how we harness and leverage collective intelligence for humanity’s betterment. Furthermore, this paradigm facilitates a knowledge market to trade and connect knowledge and brain power using $AGRS.

**Conclusion**

While many blockchain initiatives, such as Bitcoin, proclaim decentralization, they operate under centralized development teams. Contrarily, Tau Net may be described as a decentralized, expansive reasoning system, that empowers users to contribute information that simultaneously serves as software, which Tau Net is able process and integrate into subsequent versions. This unique approach fosters mass collective intelligence, enabling rapid, robust collaborative development, and truly decentralizes the development process in a coherent manner.

**Upcoming Milestones: Tau Language & Testnet**

We're on the brink of releasing the **Tau Language and Testnet**, major milestones that will significantly enhance our ecosystem's capabilities. These developments are a testament to our commitment to innovation and our vision for a decentralized future.

**Join Us: AMA Details and Resources**

Mark your calendars for **March 25th at 6pm UTC** and prepare your questions. Whether you're curious about the technical aspects, the vision behind Tau Net, or how you can get involved, we're here to answer.

You will need ETH on Arbitrum one and Arbitrum nova in order to initiate the bridge in either direction and to use MOON after completing the bridge. You can fund your wallet with ETH on both networks via [kraken,](https://www.kraken.com/) crypto.com, gate.io, [orbiter,](https://www.orbiter.finance/) or [arbitrum’s official bridge.](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/) Kraken put together a [great guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/KrakenSupport/s/CzVb1kxPWo) for users detailing how to recover your vault, connect to Arbitrum nova and fund your wallet with ETH.

# Step 2 - Bridge via Celer

Ethereum Supply Crunch,"Hello!

It's widely acknowledged that Bitcoin's halving event plays a significant role in its price appreciation. Despite an inflation rate of approximately 2% (from what I recall), Bitcoin's price has demonstrated a robust upward trajectory over time.

Could it be that the situation with Ethereum introduces a similar, even stronger dynamic? Currently, Ethereum is experiencing a negative inflation rate due to the ongoing burning of ETH. This process has been in effect for several months already.

However, I hardly read anyone mention this anymore. Given these circumstances, one might wonder if Ethereum is poised for a similar (and unexpected) price pressure?

Are there any indicators that show that the reduction in Ethereum's supply could trigger a supply crunch, potentially accelerating its price increase?",CryptoCurrency,https://reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1blv2h8/ethereum_supply_crunch/,2024-03-23 11:37:47,-0.057051282051282064,0.5044871794871795,0.044,0.148,0.8986

Another token called “JewWifHat” (JEW) has declared the following:

>""6 million JEW will be burned over 6 years in a smart contract.""

In response to these tokens, DEXScreener tweeted the following:

McRibonomics: How McDonald's McRib and Bitcoin Are Set to Trigger the $100M Super Cycle,"7 Months ago i called out the [Bitcoin bull run and its correlation to McDonalds Fish Fillet](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/165x0f0/why_the_next_bull_run_will_be_kickstarted_by/) And now I am pleased to announce another absolutely massive indicator

In a tantalizing tale of culinary and financial innovation, the McRib, a cult classic born in 1981, emerges as a pivotal player in the saga of Bitcoin's meteoric rise to $100 million.

Crafted by McDonald's inaugural Executive Chef René Arend, the McRib burst onto the scene as a limited-time sensation, captivating taste buds around Kansas City before conquering the nation. This savory marvel, alongside its poultry predecessor, the Chicken McNuggets, cemented Arend's legacy as a culinary visionary.

But what does a saucy, rib-shaped sandwich have to do with the digital gold rush of Bitcoin? Enter the concept of McRibonomics, where the evolution of fast food mirrors the disruptive force of cryptocurrency.

Just as the McRib tantalized palates with its limited availability, Bitcoin sparked intrigue as a decentralized alternative to traditional currencies. Both phenomena captured the public's imagination, ushering in eras of excitement and speculation.

Fast forward to the present, where Bitcoin has soared to dizzying heights, recently touching $70,000 and beyond. Yet, the McRib's return to McDonald's menus remains a periodic delight, showcasing the power of nostalgia and demand-driven economics.

Now, imagine a world where the McRib's cyclical comebacks align with Bitcoin's market cycles, fueling a super cycle that propels BTC to an astounding $100 million per coin. A whimsical notion? Perhaps. But in the realm of McRibonomics, where culinary cravings intersect with digital dreams, anything is possible.

So, as you savor the tangy goodness of a McRib, dare to dream of a future where its fleeting appearances coincide with Bitcoin's bullish surges, culminating in a financial feast fit for the history books.

Crypto and Web 3 will never be mainstream,"Yes the title is a bit provocative but as the years go by I think is as evident as ever that crypto in the sense of having your cold or hot wallet (especially cold wallets) will never be mainstream, even cex that are way more user friendly like binance (from my experience the most user friendly) will be used way more in comparison but not by the normal person, I think It would be used only as backend or as something like ETF,  they defeat the purpose of decentralization but there's nothing we can do.
The only example that comes to mind is something similar to gold, it's very unusual for normal people to use it or buy it physically and keeping it in they're safe at home but it's still used behind the scene, buying something that represents it online or inside normal object.

My way of approximating the potential high of a coin or token.,"Once you figure out which coins or tokens that you want to own, and I am sure you have several, you then need to figure out which coins or tokens you need to allocate most of your money.

As an example, we can see that Filecoin hit an all time high of $237 USD back in April 2021.  At the current price of $8.85, you may think that it can go up 26.8 times.  But in the near future, it will not.  All these coins and tokens have much more in circulation than they did during the last bull run, and so if Filecoin went up 26.8 times now then it will have a marketcap of $125 billion which is way more than the marketcap of Tether (USDT) which is the #3 coin in marketcap ranking.

What I do is look at the marketcaps of the top 10 coins/tokens and figure out how many times more my coins or tokens need to go up by in order to reach the same marketcap.  For example, if Avalanche has a marketcap of $20.724 billion and it is in #10 spot then Filecoin with a marketcap of $4.652 billion, needs to go up by (20.724 divided by 4.652) 4.4549 time.  In other words, at current price of $8.85, it needs to go up to (8.85 x 4.4549) $39.43  Is this possible?  Sure.  Do not look at the all time high of $237 and expect Filecoin to get there again.  But it can get to $39.43.  So if you invest $1000 into Filecoin, it may go to $4455, if it makes it to the top ten at current prices.

Of course this is not exact science and of course even the top 10 coins and tokens will also go up in value and so will their marketcaps.  But it will give you an idea of how to divide up your investments.  This is how I allocate my money as I buy $100 worth every so often to dollar-cost-average.  A good example of one  of my top coins is Graph.  I allocated most of my money into this because I figured at that time, it had the most upside potential, and I am already up 3 times.

Why should there be an Altcoin-Season again?," 

Hi,

People argue that after a significant Bitcoin rally, an altcoin season always follows. This pattern is expected to recur.

I understand this argument based on historical data points: Investments in Bitcoin can easily be redirected to altcoins since funds, whether in the form of stablecoins or Bitcoin itself, can be smoothly converted into altcoins through centralized exchanges (CEXes) and decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms.

However, a question arises about the billions of dollars currently flowing into Bitcoin: what becomes of them? I presume these Bitcoins are secured in ETF wallets, and it appears that the USD to buy ETFs is kept outside of the cryptocurrency sphere.

So, what is the rationale behind the pro-altcoin season viewpoint?",CryptoCurrency,https://reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1blpeyy/why_should_there_be_an_altcoinseason_again/,2024-03-23 06:51:58,0.08854166666666667,0.4697916666666666,0.042,0.059,0.2881

Bitcoin maxi culture feels like a cult.,"Everytime I interact with a BTC maxi I get the feeling like I am talking to a brainwashed cult member. They seem to hold unwavering and absolute beliefs in the superiority of Bitcoin over all other cryptocurrencies/assets.

They tend to view the world in binary terms, where Bitcoin is seen as the one true solution to all monetary problems, while all other cryptocurrencies are dismissed as unworthy or fraudulent. This lack of nuance mirrors the black-and-white thinking often found in cult ideologies.

They exhibit hostility towards dissent and are fiercely defensive of their beliefs and often respond with  resentment to any criticism or questioning of Bitcoin's supremacy. This intolerance of dissenting opinions can create an echo chamber effect within the community. I have lost count of how many BTC  people have blocked me for even mentioning other coins.

They have a strong emotional attachment to Bitcoin's success. This emotional investment, is combined with the belief in Bitcoin's inevitable triumph and a ""Us versus them"" mentality.

Opinion / Food-for-Thought,"Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) often spark intense debate within the blockchain community, with some championing complete decentralization while others emphasize the practicalities of mainstream adoption.

As we journey towards a cashless society, the integration of CBDCs opens doors to unprecedented efficiency and accessibility. Embracing this evolution isn't about compromising decentralization—it's about striking a harmonious balance between innovation and regulation to foster widespread adoption.  


Debate for/against r/CryptoCurrency ?",CryptoCurrency,https://reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1bm2tu1/opinion_foodforthought/,2024-03-23 17:01:18,0.11071428571428572,0.31607142857142856,0.0,0.154,0.9403
Bitcoin in a Roth IRA (US); a way to catch up or actually retire later in life,"This is just a PSA, advice on finances, not professional help, for anyone who doesn't understand how powerful a Roth IRA is with Bitcoin.

Let me briefly explain how this financial tool is top tier for anyone who doesn't understand any type of 101 on Roth IRAs. You can make a lot of money through a Roth IRA and therefore the government has put a lot of restrictions on this tool. 

A Roth IRA is a financial account you can contribute to over the course of a year up to a specific limit, which is $7000 for anyone under 50, and up to $8000 for people over 50 as of 2024. 

There is also a limit on your income. If you make over $161,000 as a single filer, or over $228,000 if you file jointly with a spouse. If you are over these income amounts then you cannot contribute directly to a Roth IRA. 

Lastly, your contributions to a Roth IRA cannot be more than your earned income. Meaning having some sort of income at some point during the year is necessary.

What are the time limits on a Roth IRA? 5 years after initial contribution or 59 1/2. Any withdrawals before that have penalties, AKA essentially taxes. 

So why put $7000 into a Roth IRA to only withdraw much later in life? Because you, generally, are paying taxes on the money put into the account and DO NOT pay taxes on the profits when you withdraw past the time limits. 

Example: you contribute $5k a year, for 10 years, to a Roth IRA, bringing the total to $50k contributions. You leave it there growing until you turn 59 1/2 and during that time it 10x to $500k. You can withdraw those gains without paying taxes on those gains, legally. No worrying about the IRS hunting you down years and years later, or being audited and having to do a bunch of maneuvers to avoids fines or jail time. 

Why you would do this comes down to a simple question: do you believe you'll be paying more taxes now, or more taxes later in life? I foresee most governments taxing their citizens more and more over the decades, USA included. So pay the taxes now, not later. Make those gains tax-free. 

Currently you can open Roth IRAs with actual Bitcoin and crypto, or with Bitcoin ETFs, or with Bitcoin adjacent companies like Cleanspark, Riot, or Microstrategy. Bitcoin is averaging, over time, gains of roughly 140% per year, and is likely to continue massive gains for years and years to come. In 10-40 years it is possible Bitcoin could be worth magnitudes higher than now and if you had gains in a Roth IRA you would legally be able to obtain those gains with no tax penalty. 

Could things change years from now? Possibly, unfortunately. But the government is not likely to change the Roth IRA too drastically any time soon, or be able to change it completely all at once. 

If I made any mistakes or mistyped something please correct me. For those who see this and think ""that does sound good"" ... yes, yes it is. This is a long-term financial tool, not a 'make money quick' tool. Use it as intended and maybe 10, 20 years from now you'll be able to appreciate how much is sitting in your Roth IRA and be thankful you have a nest egg for later in life/when you retire. 

Lastly, there are a few small details that you should always explore when investing, for example, you can buy the ETFs on Fidelity but not Vanguard, or you would want to setup a Roth IRA where you DO have control of the investments which is the bulk of them but some financial institutions take control, etc....

Name the worst performer in your crypto holdings,"For mine, I hate to say it but it's Monero. It broke my heart but I'm still holding it for the long term though. It's known for its privacy transaction, but I treat it as a private store of value.

The less worse performers of mine are ADA and Matic, although they surged but still underperformed Bitcoin. I had swapped them for BTC/ETH/AR. (No offence to the ADA and Matic communities. ADA is cool but bit too slow in development, I just lost patience. Matic is losing market share to other layer 2s, this sector's competition is getting too fierce.)

UK and withdrawals to fiat.,"Hi team.

I’m looking to head off any problems before they arise.

I want to gift some crypto to someone.  They are based in the UK and bank with Nat West.

I have talked them through setting up an account with Kraken.  This has now been completed and they are good to go (although the account has not yet been funded in any way).

When I transfer them some BTC/ETH will they be able to convert to fiat and cash out or will there be a problem (either with the bank or with Kraken).

Note: I understand “they shouldn’t sell” and all the tax implications.

Revolutionize Your Crypto Strategy with Kollit: Where Market Insight Meets Game Theory!,"Hi all!

I am very happy to launch today my new tool called Kollit!

[kollit.streamlit.app](https://kollit.streamlit.app)

It's a tool i've been working on for some time now and been using it myself.

I'm a Master’s student in Computer Science, focusing on AI and statistics at one of the top universities in europe. I have been in the crypto space for the last 5ish years and I decided i wanted to study computer science because of crypto! This background inspired me to create **Kollit**, a new groundbreaking tool designed to redefine how we approach crypto exit / entry strategies.

### The Birth of Kollit: Navigating the Waters of Regret

At the heart of Kollit is the concept of managing trading regret, an approach that is not entirely explored in this field. 

* **Regret of Action:** The sinking feeling when you realize you sold or bought too early.
* **Regret of Inaction:** The missed opportunities because you hesitated to make a move.

Kollit introduces a groundbreaking way to balance these regrets using your market expectations. Here’s how:

* By analyzing your personalized market outlook, Kollit identifies  optimal points for buying or selling that align with your risk tolerance  and market predictions.
* My algorithm then mathematically balances the **regret of action** with the **regret of inaction**, tailoring a strategy that not only fits your market view but also your personal trading style.

I use market simulations based on your predictions to explore a few scenarios given your market expectations and risk tolerance to find the best fitting strategy. 

### A Work in Progress: Kollit’s Journey

Kollit is my baby, currently in its first stage but it will keep evolving. It's 100% free but not 100% free of bugs and glitchs. Bear with it and you will get the exit plan you always needed!

&#x200B;

Did I avoid being hacked/scammed?,"TL;DR at the bottom

So, I was scrolling through twitter yesterday checking some tweets about an airdrop I am participating in, and below one of the main accounts tweets, was another tweet (impersonating the main one) mentioning something about a vote, and me, thinking this was legit, went ahead and wanted to partake in said vote. 

I went to the website, and connected to the website with metamask. Metamask didn't show any sign of problems connecting but the website did, so I tried for about 3 times, disconnecting from metamask and connecting again, and around the third time was when it hit me: ""This site isn't official, must be a scam"", so I went to check the tweet and yes, it was a fake one, and my heart sank like never before hahah so I quickly disconnected and started to check if everything was alright. I didn't get to sign any transaction or any allowances for tokens or anything, just connected to the website. 

I immediately thought that someone most probably must have drained my account and made a transfer, but I then checked etherscan and nothing. It's been more than 20 hours and I haven't seen any transactions in any block explorer, nor do I have any token allowances, everything is intact, so far. Did I really dodged being scammed? Did it save me by not signing any transactions? Am I still at risk by having connected to the website but not doing anything? Ive been trying to check if there's anything to revoke, but can't find anything in particular, nor if there is a history of the websites that I have connected with metamask. Is there anything specific I should do? Any advice is much appreciated :)

What am I doing wrong..?,"**Disclaimer: I am a beginner using crypto for the last three months with the help of trust  wallet. I started using it because I wanted  something which did not ask for kyc and an acquaintance recommended it.**   

It seems okayish but I am always anxious about getting hacked and losing my money. 

Also,  I am not happy with the transaction charges. Ten days  back I swapped some ETH to USDT and the network charges was huge in my  opinion. See the pic below. The transaction charge was about 5% of the total amount. It's very high as compared to banks. Am I over-reacting?   

 Also, even if I want to make a small transaction with USDT, it charges about $11. That seems very unfair.   

Please advise.   I am looking for a way to transact that is safe, private(no kyc), and reasonable transaction charges.

Everything to know (so far) about Moons on Arbitrum One.,"**The Bridge is open and Moons are on Arbitrum One. Here's everything you need to know about Moons on Arbitrum One.**

\_\_\_

**Number 1:** Moons are not Migrating you don't need to do anything with your Moons on Nova. This simply opens the door to be able to use Moons on both Nova and One.

\_\_\_

**Number 2:** There are two ways to Bridge Moons between Nova and One.

* Option 1 is the [Official Arbitrum Bridge](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/?destinationChain=ethereum&sourceChain=arbitrum-nova) \- this method takes seven days and requires multiple transaction on mainnet ETH so it requires lots of gas, and shouldn't be used unless you're bridging large amounts of Moons between Nova and One.

https://preview.redd.it/g4wkobw07xpc1.png?width=880&format=png&auto=webp&s=06408e492a73b9e20e4b4f1b3ecf420ff99f71ae

* Option 2 is the [Celer Bridge](https://cbridge.celer.network/42170/42161/MOON), this Bridge goes directly between Nova and One using User Provided Liquidity Pools on both sides. This allows users to earn Liquidity Fees with 0 impermanent loss. I have a write up on how the pools works [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1bjxom1/celer_bridge_incentive_overview_and_liquidity/).

https://preview.redd.it/dncso2r27xpc1.png?width=679&format=png&auto=webp&s=b48eaf267ddc2d98ee7d8faca2742f241ebf97c3

\_\_\_

**Number 3:** How to add Arbitrum One and Moons to your Hot Wallet.

Unlike Nova, Arbitrum One is an incredibly easy network to add to your Hot Wallet. (below are the steps for MetaMask)

https://preview.redd.it/zrvcb1967xpc1.png?width=2226&format=png&auto=webp&s=80d2ef3ebdcd242757c9a20eb7c31f9b97c2ef7b

Press the ""Network"" button -> Press ""Add network"" -> Press ""Add"" next to Arbitrum One -> Press ""Approve""

Once Arbitrum One is added you'll need to add Moons as a token

https://preview.redd.it/8oh69zp47xpc1.png?width=2098&format=png&auto=webp&s=4db76236514d2796e42c9ca54de20383c79026ed

While on the Arbitrum One Network - Select the ""Tokens"" Tab -> Press ""Import tokens"" -> Enter the following Token Contract Address **0x24404DC041d74cd03cFE28855F555559390C931b** \-> Press ""Next"" -> Press ""Import"".

You can now see Moons as an Asset in your hot wallet on Arbitrum One.

\_\_\_

**Number 4:** How to buy and sell Moons on Arbitrum One.

Liquidity for Moons is currently being added to Camelot. [This link](https://app.camelot.exchange/) takes you to the trading page on Camelot to buy and sell Moons on Arbitrum One.

Currently there is $252K in Moon/Eth liquidity on Camelot.

\_\_\_

**Number 5:** Why Camelot?

The answer is Arbitrum Rewards for liquidity providers. Although these are not live for Moons yet - Camelot has a grant from the Arbitrum Foundation to subsidize liquidity providers on Camelot with ARB tokens. So growing TVL and Volume on Camelot will allow Moon Liquidity Providers to start seeing extra rewards in the form of ARB.

Once Camelot offers ARB rewards - I will look at making a guide on how to add liquidity to Camelot, if you want to add liquidity before then you can do so using [this link](https://app.camelot.exchange/pools/0x5e27A422ec06A57567a843FD65A1BBB06aC19FC0).",CryptoCurrency,https://reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1bl4uwy/everything_to_know_so_far_about_moons_on_arbitrum/,2024-03-22 13:27:36,0.11274651274651275,0.39966931216931223,0.005,0.056,0.9604
L2s are against crypto's core ideology of decentralization and still people praising it,"We all can agree that high gas fee isn't good. This is probably the the main reason why L2s come in play.

But L2s are so centralized. Coinbase's BASE L2 is run by just a couple servers...same goes for Arbitrum, Optimish, Starknet, Linea...

Crypto's core ideology is decentralization, what sense does it make to have one decent decentralized L1 on which dozens of very centralized L2s operating on top of it?!

If the L2 fail, your L1 coins are gone! Your L2 coins are just a mirror of the real L1 coins.

Not your keys, not your coins...this is the saying when it comes to CEXes VS self-custodial wallets, but in terms of L1 and L2s the same goes, too. If you ""own"" your coins on a L2, this doesn't 100% represent your coins. As long as the L2 functions, you're fine. If they fail, you can kiss your coins goodbye!

As this isn't crypto perversion enough, there are new upcoming L2s that uses EVM + SVM + Data availbility on another blockchain (I won't call out the names).

If just 1 of the underlying mechanics fail, you either lose your coins or a ""backup""-functions kicks in which turns gas fee as high as on mainnet.

I hope this helps you. I'm also here to answer any questions. 

The TL;DR is that it's not a scam and the yield is legitimate (coming from the funding rate of perpetual shorts and native ETH yield. But you should really understand what's going on behind the scenes because this is not your normal stable coin and there are additional risks to consider.

QR coin update. BTC considering BIP proposals to be ready like Vitalik?,"Some very good conversations going on around what approach to take with upgrading for QR (Quantum Resistance).  Most of this got a lot of attention after Apple revealed their QR solution, along with Vitalik referring to a potential emergency plan if it became necessary.  


The discussion often turns to ""when"" changes need to be implemented, and some of that will depend on what user action is required.  From the conversation below, it looks like the currently recommended QR encryption methods may not be an ideal solution.  But, these are also the best options known after years of effort to see what can protect against quantum capabilities.  So BTC may have to work within these constraints.  


The goal of course will be to minimize disruption and provide the necessary time to develop and allow users to make the transition if necessary.

Below are some projects with QR label that I have been giving updates as quantum gets more attention.  Their main focus isn't just being prepared for quantum resistance, but they stand to benefit from the narrative since they have planned for quantum resistance all along.  In the end, all chains and systems will need to prepare.  The question will be how well they navigate this.  Being prepared from the beginning offers obvious advantages.

QANX- still making a steady climb ahead of its mainnet push. Recent news of an EU country utilizing the QR tech stack with ethereum board member Patrick Storchenegger part of the partnership. ETH like design, PoS, with evm compatible multi-language smart contracts and dev royalties.

CELL- had a nice run-up since Jan. A decent pullback recently which might offer opportunity. Appears to be more of a DOT type design. Had a Coin Bureau club review video which didn't do much, but some buzz around Kelvpn seems to be helping.

QRL- Built for QR years ago, and was quiet until recently. May have been because it was hard to buy, but Mexc was added, and they are working to add in evm and smart contracts.  Seems to be holding it's new level.

Algo- Most are familiar, it appears to have added Falcon as quantum resistance for consensus purposes, but I haven't seen if they have a solution defined for Digital Signature- which is the primary issue Vitalik was prepared for.

XX, AME, XEP and a few others I know less about have also been mentioned for preparing.

Four Months of RCC Performance Tracking! What's in store for the future?,"Happy Friday Everyone! Hope you're brackets aren't too busted up after yesterday! My 5 year old actually picked the Oakland upset of Kentucky (how could she not pick them when their mascot is the Golden Grizzlies haha!). 

Hard to believe I'm now four months into this journey tracking RCCs. I'm sure some of you all get tired of seeing my posts each week, but my reason for starting this was to try and bring more exposure to our space and the various subs and to see if there are any diamonds in the rough that may be worth holding onto long term. I'll have the weekly data and monthly updates in this post so take a look and see if there's anything that jumps out to you.

Here's the data from last week 3.15.24:

https://preview.redd.it/lx0u7aogawpc1.png?width=685&format=png&auto=webp&s=a893153f816b71569e263e903fa2225d7b7995d7

And here's the data I pulled this morning 3.22.24:

https://preview.redd.it/ww711vbgawpc1.png?width=713&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c0dda1c543860bd5bc9e16abdd86e8e7cee74a3

1. I think it's quite obvious that they first thing jumping off the page is the move MOON has had over the last week. Seemingly out of nowhere it pumped majorly, has overtaken Banano and seems to be setting itself up for some consolidation. People are bullish (and/or FOMOing) on moons again and I think that's good news for all RCCs. Bricks also made a huge move over the last week but I have a hard time taking that coin seriously.
2. The top three meme coins slid just a bit this week. Seeing MOONs and Bricks made me think that the first trickle down effect from large caps pumping is taking place and people are moving from top tier meme coins down to the more risky (market cap wise) plays. So I think it's quite possible our RCCs are in for some interesting movements in the coming weeks. 
3. CONE I think is the winner of the week for Polygon RCCs. Gained a bit of market cap while most others slid. Hopefully we're getting some consolidation at these levels and I'm looking forward to seeing what is to come. We might finally get to drop that next zero for good sooner than later.
4. Don't want to discount GODL, they had a really really nice week of gains, probably the biggest mover for the RCCs. Looks to be on a bullish trajectory as well. I'll speak on TACO here as well, good to see them holding strong. It has been a huge boon for them getting linked up with the big tacos sub and I think that is extremely bullish for their future.
5. Most of the rest had a rather disappointing week, everyone else dropped or were flat. So not much to say about them. Hopefully we can get a bounce back week coming up (maybe what I said earlier will ring true and we'll see more trickle down).

This info kinda speaks for itself, tracking sub growth since I started tracking this data point in January. I'm most interested in this data for the subs that have not officially released their tokens yet to see how the growth hits them once they got added to the CommunityPointsBot umbrella and then once their token is released.

That's it for today, I know pretty much nobody reads down this far but after this week I'm going to take a look at cutting back on the number of subs I'm posting in. Any feedback on that would be appreciated! I've kicked around just sticking to the subs with higher member numbers and I feel like the posts would tend to just get lost so like I said, thinking through it.

I had $20K stolen after approving transactions on a fraudulent website,"So, I messed up... I always tried to be super careful and verify links and everything, but I got in a rush and didn't pay enough attention.

The Coinbase Base page on X made a post about an NFT, so I went to the link and minted it.

Then the first reply under that post had another link, and the profile was made to look exactly like the Base page, and I clicked that link, connected my wallet, and approved a couple of transactions.

Immediately I came to my senses and realized the page looked off, and in a blink of an eye, $10,000 in USDC on Base and $10,000 in USDC on Avalanche left my wallet. I couldn't believe that I messed up so bad. Usually I'm incredibly careful, and I know that the majority of posts on X are scams, but I rushed too much. I feel so dumb.

Has anyone had this happen? Did you report it?

I decided to report it to the SEC, CFTC, FTC, and FBI. I wasn't going to because I messed up, but I figured I might as well, but nothing will probably come from it.

I looked up the WHOIS for the website, and it lists a name and the state of MN, but I assume that's bogus information. But who knows?

Any advice?

I assume there's not much I can do besides being more careful in the future and slowing down.

Anyone else been through this?

Choose the date you want to sell instead,"I read about so many people choosing when to buy and sell this year or the next, taking profits, etc.  I’ve experienced both sides of the coin(pun intended).  When I bought a full Bitcoin in 2017 I got to see my coin shoot up to $20k and then back down to around $3k and so I started taking profits around $13k.  Made profit.  Then I got to see Bitcoin shoot up to $65k without me and it made me sad that I’d never get to own a full coin again.  Luckily I managed to DCA to own a full coin again, but it let me realize that even if you “win” and take your profit you may still not be happy.

So I recommend to everyone choose a price point or a date that will make you happy instead of just trying to take short small gains.

Europe's Blockchain Evolution: LTO - Bridging Real World Assets and DeFi,"Hey Reddit,

Dive into how Europe is leading a blockchain revolution, cleverly merging Real World Assets (RWA) with the digital age of decentralized finance (DeFi). Forget the complexity; think of blockchain as the new digital bridge making asset ownership and transfers as simple and secure as sending an email.

At present, the blockchain hosts approximately $1.3 billion in Real-World Assets (RWAs), with the sector expanding to a market value of $1.05 billion in 2023 alone. A significant portion of this growth, about 82% or $855.7 million, originated from sectors such as treasuries, real estate, and private credit. Recognized figures in both the conventional finance and cryptocurrency spheres are heralding RWAs as the next big leap in crypto's growth journey. Projections suggest that by the year 2030, the on-chain presence of RWAs could skyrocket to an impressive $16 trillion.

This surge in RWAs on the blockchain highlights a transformative period where digital and physical asset worlds converge, reflecting Europe's pioneering role in this space.

Enter LTO Network, a great example of this evolution. It's not just another blockchain platform; it's Europe's beacon for integrating business operations with blockchain, making real-world asset tokenization a reality. This platform stands out with its hybrid architecture—combining the best of both worlds: public and private layers. This means enhanced security, privacy, and efficiency, all while keeping things scalable and compliant.

LTO Network is on a mission to not just adapt but to lead in the RWA space. By focusing on tokenizing real assets and ensuring seamless integration with DeFi, LTO is creating a future where digital and physical assets coexist on a secure, transparent blockchain platform, aiming for significant market growth and introducing initiatives like the EQTY platform to further bridge DeFi and RWAs.

In essence, LTO Network embodies Europe's innovative approach to blockchain, offering a practical solution where technology meets traditional finance, driving towards a future of decentralized, efficient, and inclusive financial ecosystems.

"If you invest, you need to lose first","Despite we common narrative that crypto only goes up, it goes up and down.

If anyone comes into the crypto space to have only profits going up, you're entering this space with a wrong mindset.

Not only in crypto, but for investments in general, you need to learn to ""lose"".

Unless you've bought from the total bottom (which is 99.999% never we case), you will see yourself sitting in a net loss for a period of time...mark my words ""period of time"".

If we're in a bullmarket 

**and**

if we're still in a bullmarket

**and**

if you're still holding your winning coins without selling at a loss earlier...

...then you've made profits. This is how investing works...everywhere.

Holding coins doesn't mean to marry your coins. It does mean holding when the time is right and ~~divorcing~~ selling when the time has come.

How to hold, what to hold and wen to sell, this is the 1 million dollar question and very difficult to perform.

"Newbie advice: Not looking for gains, just don't want massive losses","I hope I don't get flack for this, but I'm not only a crypto newbie but a total trading Luddite. I got a coinbase account, no wallet, for the purpose of being able to purchase from sites that offer discounts for buying with crypto. I have no real interest in buying crypto to make a profit or really looking to trade, I did all my pre-purchase checks and read the stuff coinbase asks you to as well as some of my own research so I know that getting fully into crypto isn't really for me.

One thing I'm not sure of though is knowing what to buy that has moderate fluctuation in value so as to not log in to make a purchase and find that £100 or so in coins I have in my account has suddenly dipped to being worth nothing (yes, I know losing everything is a risk in any investment)

I have (very small) amounts of USDC, Bitcoin Cash, and Cosmos, to use/trade into other coins or make purchases with.

I saw that Bitcoin has had some dips in market value, but this is \`normal\` for before a halving (still learning what that is)

**Would the advice for a newb like me to not bother keeping anything in my account and just purchase coins when I want to use crypto to buy items, or could investing a small (like, £100 or so) amount into Bitcoin right now be a safe way to maybe bump up my future spending money?**

DCA strategy using the Fear & Greed Index - Surprising Results [FOLLOW UP],"A few weeks ago I downloaded all historical data from the Fear and Greed Index, and wrote a backtesting script in python. **I wanted to find out how DCA performed if you increased your DCA amount the more FEARFUL the market was, and invested very little during times of greed.** The post is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1bb963s/dca_strategy_using_the_fear_greed_index/).

**Tons of people asked me to incorporate selling** during EXTREME GREED, and also pointed out **other metrics** they wanted me to test. So here it is!

**Start date:  March 17th  2018**  
**End Date:  September 9th 2023 (Bottom or Top is not a fair end date)**  


# 1. Benchmark DCA 

Traditional “vanilla” DCA to measure our results against. 

* $100 invested each 7 days

# 2. Fear & Greed DCA NO SELLING

Each 7 days we check the F&G index and invest:

* $150 if “Extreme Fear”  
$100 if “Fear”  
$75 if “Neutral”  
$50 if “Greed”  
$25 if “Extreme Greed”

# 3. Fear & Greed DCA WITH SELLING

Each 7 days we check the F&G index and:

* $150 if “Extreme Fear”  
$100 if “Fear”  
$75 if “Neutral”  
$50 if “Greed”  
Sell 5% of accumulated BTC if “Extreme Greed”

# 4. PI Cycle Top Indicator

More than one person asked me to test this one. The PI cycle top is the 111D and the 350D MA x2. It can be found [here](https://studio.glassnode.com/metrics?a=BTC&m=indicators.PiCycleTop) for example. The idea is when the 111D cross above the 350Dx2, you should run for the hills.   
Each 7 days we check if the 111D is below the 350Dx2 and:

* $100 invested if below  
Sell everything if above

# 5. AlphaSquared Risk Model DCA

The top comment mentioned this one. I signed up for a free account to test it so you don’t have to.  I used their default “Aggressive” strategy with 0% profits reinvested. 

Each 7 days we check the risk and:

* $130 if risk if 0/100  
$120 if risk is 20/100  
$50 if risk is 55/100….. And so on  
Sell 30% if risk 80/100   
Sell 70% of if risk 90/100

&#x200B;

# 6. Drumroll.......The results!

&#x200B;

|Strategy|ROI (Returns)|Portfolio Value (BTC)| Amount Invested|SATS per Dollar|Profit/Loss ($)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|DCA|**124.81%**|**2.48 BTC**|**$28 600**|**8 680**|**$35,694**|
|F&G NO SELL|**140.09%**|**2.64 BTC**|**$28.000**|**9 425**|**$40,346**|
|F&G W/ SELL|**184.18%**|**3.08 BTC**|**$28,125**|**10 973**|**$51,800**|
|PI Cycle Top Indicator|**332.44%**|**4.71BTC**|**$28,200**|**16 697**|**$93,748**|
|AlphaSquared Risk Metric|**385.00%**|**5.23 BTC**|**$28,030**|**18 756**|**$108,127**|

*\* Final Value (BTC) = The value of your entire portfolio in BTC. We value like this since even for the strategies where you sell to fiat, you can immediately convert it to BTC at the final price if you like.*  
*\* SATS per dollar = Wealth-in-BTC / Amount-Invested*  


# IMPORTANT!!

**This is just my testing and ideally you should conduct these tests across several time frames.** I might actually do that because I think these results warrant a more thorough investigation using confidence intervals or statistical significance. For example, both PI Cycle Top and AlphaSquared was created after 2018 so you want to adjust for that. That would take some more effort though, **so please let me know if that’s something you guys are interested in**.   


**Regardless these are very convincing results in favor of adjusting your DCA strategy. Hope you find it useful in the upcoming bull!**

Institutional investors will be eyeing Litecoin,"In my opinion, institutional investors will be eyeing Litecoin in the near term. Currently, all eyes are on bitcoin in the world of institutional investing, but as its market cap continues to rise, investors will begin to look for comparable coins. 

When they are looking for comparable coins they will have a few things on their checklist : proof of work, hard cap, security, decentralization. This will be the criteria, not only because bitcoin checks all these boxes, but because these items also make for the perfect investment vehicle / store of value. If Bitcoin is digital gold, then Litecoin is digital silver. Investors are realizing this fast.

Institutional investors are becoming more and more wary of coins like Ethereum and Solana because they are concerned that the SEC will label them unregistered securities. They do not have that fear when it comes to Litecoin, because its framework is so similar to Bitcoin, which has been declared a commodity. 

I believe this cycle is all about institutional adoption, and Litecoin is a well oiled machined, right next to bitcoin, waiting to be scooped up for a fraction of the price. 

Would love to hear everyone’s thoughts!

Clarification Please: What is Benjamin Cowen suggesting?,"I am having difficulty fully understanding BC’s thesis. What I understand it to be (from virtually all of Benjamin Cowen’s recent videos) is that he basically is suggesting that BTC is very near its top, and if it holds the eight week SMA, there could be one final push higher. Is he suggesting that’s it for the entire cycle? Or just in the short term?

Also, he constantly goes on and on about BTC only pumping higher if alt coins durably break down against their BTC pairs, meaning their valuations drop against BTC. So, is he also suggesting that there will not be any kind alt season where alts pump drastically against BtCs valuation after BTC tops (which we have seen in every cycle)? 

He keeps going back to the 2019 mid cycle pump and suggesting that that move is the same as this one — but he fails to mention the halving at all, or the fact that BTC has just broke an all time high… the two moves are very different IMO, or am I missing something? 

To me this current move (and market move in general) is more similar to the 2021 peak, which was followed by a massive pump in alt coin valuations.

Can anyone provide more clarity or deeper context as to what he’s suggesting? 

Basically that BTC is approaching a cycle peak, and that altcoins will crash after the BTc cycle tops, and that there will be no alt season? Is that what he’s saying?

Celsius suing people who withdrew before bankruptcy?,"Just spotted a tweet from an influencer getting hit with a lawsuit from Celsius for withdrawing a hefty sum before their bankruptcy declaration. It’s one of those “preference liability” claims, aiming to reel in funds taken out by the fast movers in the days leading up to their financial crash. The kicker? They’re offering a settlement to close the deal at a discount.... seems kind of scammy from Celsius?

The tweet: https://twitter.com/Zata_Zu/status/1770502728738857005 



Legal jargon is as clear as mud, and international laws on crypto are as consistent as Bitcoin’s price on a bad day.

The gist of the claim is about 'fairness'—Celsius says that late withdrawals (before they went bankrupt, mind you) left less in the pot for everyone else. They're using the old bankruptcy rulebook to try and balance the books, but when it comes to overseas account holders, things get murky.

Ever wondered how do nodes find each other on the Bitcoin network? I assume most of you didn't hear about seed nodes / DNS nodes.,"https://academy.bit2me.com/en/que-es-un-nodo-semilla/

These nodes are run by trusted members of Bitcoin devteam. These servers are the gates before entering the network. 

Is there any risk of disruption? I assumed cryptos were by design completely trustless. Meaning youd need to pull the electricity to take it down, that's how robust I assumed it was. Cuz even theres a node on a Satellite. 

Now a human built design when it comes to money will be trident tested. This feature seems like the human element. And going by Murphy's eventually there will be a hickup somewhere.

Any crypto swing traders out there?,Been in a crypto game a long while and have been dabbling in some test swing trades using coinmarketcap. The volatility of crypto really is appealing for a swing trader. I've identified a few coins that would be fairly good to start swing trading (regularly swing 5-8%). With $1000 starting I've been able to build a decent return when things are moving sideways. Any advice from people actively swing trading? Do you trade during the bull run? It seems like the bear market would be a little safer as its more stable sideways action at the bottom. Any tips for someone looking to deploy some profits? Obviously I'm well aware of the risks and willing to lose what I put in. Anyone start with $1000?

"The State of the Web3 User and Developer Experience in four leading Web3 platforms: Ethereum, Solana, Aptos, and Radix. - A report by CryptoEQ","# Who is CryptoEQ?

[https://www.cryptoeq.io](https://www.cryptoeq.io)

From their website:

>CryptoEQ™ is an independent cryptocurrency analysis and rating agency  that provides unbiased, objective, and transparent research you can  trust. We help people navigate their investment journey and trading  decisions. 

&#x200B;

# TL;DR:

The report compares the UX and DX across these 4 platforms by focusing on how tokens, accounts, smart contracts, and transactions within the respective virtual machines. Radix is the most secure followed by Aptos. Eth and Solana have bigger dev community.

**User Experience (UX)**

Ethereum and Solana face UX challenges like complex token behaviors, blind signing transactions, and wallet security risks. Aptos and Radix introduce improvements like predictable token standards and  human-readable transactions.

**Tokens, Accounts & NFTs**

Assets on Ethereum and Solana are based on token smart contracts, which can bring uncertainty, and smart contract risk, token's behavior is opaque. Assets on Aptos and Radix are “objects”, while on Radix these are native to the platform, offering greater transparency and security, malicious tokens are impossible.

**Transactions**

Transactions on Ethereum and Solana are “blind signed”, which results in frequent users losing funds to wallet drains or other scams. Radix's Transaction Manifest enables human-readable transactions, multiple atomic smart contract calls and user-set guarantees, improving composability and security.

**Developer Experience (DX)**

Aptos' Move language and Radix's Scrypto offer asset-oriented programming models, native features, and better security to simplify development compared to Solidity on Ethereum plus Radix's native asset-oriented tooling accelerates secure dApp development. Eth and Solana, on the other hand, have a more robust developer community and thus more libraries

"Seeking Recommendations for Crypto YouTube Channels Focused on Fundamental Analysis and Swing Trading
","
Hello everyone,

I'm not particularly interested in day trading or channels that primarily promote specific tokens or coins. Instead, I'm looking for content creators who delve into the fundamentals of alts or provide a quantitative approach into investing in some alts, providing insights into the technology behind them, market trends, socail trends and trading strategies that are more aligned with swing trading.

The reason I'm asking for YouTube channel recommendations specifically is that I find it very convenient to listen to these discussions while I'm walking or just relaxing. It's a way for me to stay informed and learn more about the crypto space without having to dedicate time exclusively for reading or screen time.

Here's what I'm ideally looking for in a YouTube channel:
- Focus on educational content over hype and speculation.
- Discussions on technological advancements and the fundamentals driving the value of different cryptocurrencies.
- Analysis of how global events and market trends could impact the crypto market.
- Insightful strategies for swing trading, including chart reading, market signals interpretation, and effective risk management.

If you have any personal favorites or know of channels that meet these criteria, please share them with me. I believe that having a solid understanding of the fundamentals and market dynamics is crucial for making informed trading decisions, and I'm eager to learn from reliable sources.

Why the main narratives around the top Crypto AI projects are all bullcrap,"Please note that this is a discussion about technology/protocol, not about price. Any Crypto AI memecoin can do super well in a bull market just by being associated with AI even if it does absolutely nothing useful. And that's what's widely happening.

**There are many problems with the top crypto AI projects, including**:

* Having extremely misleading marketing that doesn't match their technical documentation
* Having little to nothing to do with AI
* Having little to nothing to do with blockchains (aside from the token)
* Having failed economic incentives

Let's discuss the top 3.

**1. Render**

The Render Network has very little to do with AI or crypto, so Coingecko and Coinmarketcap really shouldn't be categorizing it as one. It uses Octane Render, which is a video GPU rendering platform, not an AI GPU platform. In addition, the Render Network website downplays the blockchain part, which makes sense because it's barely using blockchain technology.
	
The entire platform and process is off-chain. The market for GPU-as-a-Service existed and worked great without any blockchain. And that's what the Render Network does. **The only purpose for the RNDR token is as a payment token**. There are a few programs on Solana that assist with the payment system, and that's it. They could've used US dollars or SHIB or BabyDogeCumRocketInuPepeTrump to pay for the services, and it wouldn't have made a single difference.

**2. Fetch.ai**

Despite its name, Fetch.ai has no native AI capabilities. Its main trick is that it can play Fetch (e.g. url fetch).

Its main website is extremely misleading about AI chatbots because it can't make any. At least its developer documentation is more honest about its limitations.
	
Fetch is a platform used to make API requests to Virtual Agents (similar to extremely basic versions of M365 Power Platform Virtual Agents). These are [basic scripted non-AI chatbots](https://fetch.ai/docs/examples) similar to the ones you encounter when going through the menu of an automated phone system. They're very limited since you can't store an entire AI in a small python script. You could actually code the same natively on Ethereum using Solidity if it weren't so gas expensive, but this is probably possible now on L2s after the Dencun upgrade.

So why is Fetch claiming that it can assist with modeling AI chatbots? Because it's stretching the truth that it can obtain centralized data off-chain. Imagine talking to a virtual agent and paying for unverified responses that are all bullcrap.
	
Basically, Fetch Virtual Agents can make centralized API requests and get off-chain data. But the major problem is that the network has no way of auditing the accuracy of any external API calls. There is no way of getting accurate off-chain data without an oracle, and this is true for Fetch as well. Chainlink does this by requiring M out of N responses to agree with each other. Fetch protocol only gets 1 out of 1 response, so you can't trust the info unless you have established some trust with the Virtual Agent provider off-chain. It's basically a centralized API request service where you have to build up trust off-chain.

**3. BitTensor**
	
Bittensor is one of the closest projects to being AI-related. What it's actually supposed to do is very puzzling. Its ""About"" page describes itself multiple times as being very hard to understand, and is a rambling mess of words that feel like a AI chatbot wrote it back in 2005 before they were any good.

It's not AI. It's not machine learning. **It's a marketplace**. And it's totally up to its users to figure out what to do with it. (Hint: You can't design AI, LLM, or ML with it)

Fortunately, its technical documentation is much better at revealing what it does. It's a marketplace for subnets and miners. Each subnet has miners that create responses and validators that score those responses. The miners are then paid in TAO based on their scores.
	
Most describing BitTensor (and even Bankless) suggest that it's made for miners to create programs through machine learning. But if you read carefully, the BitTensor website does not promise or describe this.

The problem is that machine learning requires a controlled environment where the engineers control both the validators and the ML programs. In BitTensor, the engineers have no control over the miners. The miners can just get up and leave, and steal all the progress that was made. It's like OpenAI paid users to build AIs, spent the time to train them and validate, only to allow those builders to just keep the data, destroy it, sell it, or do whatever they want with it. The builders can hold the data hostage by threatening to leave and demand ransom. The end result is that the engineers do not own the data, so it makes no sense to use BitTensor for AI or machine learning.

It's cheaper and safer to pay for Infrastructure-as-a-Service within a controlled environment than on a decentralized blockchain.

However, there are still useful applications for BitTensor outside of AI-related purposes. If the engineer has a trapdoor function (some algorithm that takes orders of magnitude longer to solve than to validate), it could use the subnet to perform basic Proof of Work. They'd just be reinventing Bitcoin, but now with any custom algorithm instead of common ones like SHA-256, Keccak, and Scrypt. The subnet miners would just become literal PoW miners.

Unable to move coin for 60 days?,"Hello all, I just recently got involved in buying some crypto (BTC, ETH and SOL),through Coinbase and had moved some to a Coinbase hot wallet while leaving most on the exchange. It's only been about 4 weeks total since I started this. I recently received my Tangem hard wallet and was successful in moving my ETH and some BTC to the wallet, as I was told to do small transactions first to make sure all went well. And that did. However, I went to move about $300 of SOL to my hard wallet and it's showing as ""Pending"" for the last two days. That was from my Coinbase hot wallet. Also I went to move $2,000 of BTC off the exchange into my new hard wallet and it keeps giving me an error message and it won't complete the transaction. After several tries it says for my protection and out of caution, my funds are ""safe"" but I cannot move anything for 60 days. I wasn't prepared for this. Coinbase automated bot says I'm just on hold for 60 days. Is this something I need to be really concerned about? Kinda misses me off that I can't move my coin.

Celer Bridge Incentive Overview and Liquidity Guide.,"**The Celer Bridge is live and you likely want to know:**

* **Are the incentives to provide bridge liquidity for Moons worth it?**
* **If so how do you provide liquidity?**

This post aims to answer both of these questions.

\---------------------

# Are the incentives to provide bridge liquidity for Moons worth it?

In order to answer this question we first need to understand how the Moon Nova/One bridge works. Importantly this bridge works by users Pooling Moons on both Nova and One, which then allows others users to Transfer Moons to a Pool on one side and then receive Moons from a pool on the other side of the bridge.

*I.E. A user transferring ten Moons from Nova to One would send ten Moons to the Pool on Nova and receive ten moons minus fees from the pool on One.*

**Because the only thing being moved back and forth is Moons and you will always receive more Moons (fees) after someone uses your Pooled Moons to bridge. This allows users to farm Moon rewards with zero impermanent loss.**

\-----

In this way - on paper, it is theoretically worth it for anyone to provide Bridge Liquidity as they earn extra Moons when their Moons are used by someone else to bridge to/from nova and one.

However there are a few more considerations to make.

1. Do we know what APY looks like?
2. What are the 3rd party risks?

To Answer Question 1:

* APY of the bridge is based on supply/demand of the bridge until more time has passed we don't know what average supply/demand will look like.
   * I.E. If no one Bridges, Bridge Providers don't make fees and if lots of bridging occurs providers make a lot in fees.
* To incentivize individuals to provide Bridge Liquidity Celer announced they'll be paying out 285K Celer tokens over the first 60 days that the bridge is live. (APY for this reward will be subject to total Bridge Supply on both Nova and One.) 

To Answer Question 2:

* Whenever you place Moons in the custody of a 3rd party you open yourself to a 3rd party risk. It doesn't matter if that's with a CEX like Kraken, a DEX like Camelot/Sushi, or a Bridging Service like Celer. If something happens like a hack/exploit, you could lose your Moons that are in the custody of the third party.

Given the fact that rewards come with Zero Impermanent Loss you have to decide if the third party risk makes sense for you to farm Celer Bridge Rewards, and if it does the amount of Moons you want to provide Bridge Liquidity with.

\---------------------

# How do you provide liquidity?

Providing Liquidity on Celer is incredibly Simple. First go to the Liquidity Page for the Celer Bridge.

[https://cbridge.celer.network/liquidity](https://cbridge.celer.network/liquidity)

https://preview.redd.it/10pvyt8l2mpc1.png?width=1826&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f537402a478e1771479c9d4085bdd1b1aefecd0

Once there connect your wallet that you will be providing Bridge liquidity with - once you've connected your wallet you can search Moon to find the Moon Pool or alternatively scroll through the pools until you see the Moon pool.

https://preview.redd.it/uwge3o446ppc1.png?width=1765&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7cc91242cf35a39d5f6ef17704129fef01914e0

Once you've found it expand the section and press the plus sign to add liquidity for Moons on Arbitrum Nova or Arbitrum One. **Importantly you do not need to provide Bridge Liquidity on both sides.**

https://preview.redd.it/yj5fyplu5ppc1.png?width=1439&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab633a4d7da721752af906df73bb5a2823d825b3

*For this example I will be providing Liquidity on Nova. (but it's the same idea for One)*

Press the add Liquidity button *(it will prompt you to switch to Arbitrum Nova if you are not already there, switch to Arbitrum Nova find the Moon Pool and press Add Liquidity again)* and the following page will load.

https://preview.redd.it/xel3p1lo2mpc1.png?width=630&format=png&auto=webp&s=788c726363b49bf0ffb7c4a6c923a9f3e72d6615

**Important note: You must provide more than 35 Moons in Bridge Liquidity (35.1 works, 35 does not)**

Approve the Moons in your wallet,

https://preview.redd.it/zbw3dmjp2mpc1.png?width=487&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e36b709a20a83a0e1c104bce312d6f91feea53d

**Important note 2: It is always recommended to ONLY APPROVE the total amount of Moons you'll be adding and never press Max.**

Once you approve the transaction the previous page will load for a few second and then show an Add Liquidity button.

https://preview.redd.it/7ndan1tq2mpc1.png?width=619&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9e83aaeb272582bf1d930f7bf6a21153f6a8c65

Confirm the transaction in your wallet and wait!

Once the Transaction goes through you can then go back to the Moon Pool on Celer and you will now see your share of the liquidity on the display.

As people bridge to/from Nova and One your liquidity will move between the two pools. You can remove liquidity at any time from either pool by pressing the negative button, and following the prompts to remove your liquidity from that pool.",CryptoCurrency,https://reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1bjxom1/celer_bridge_incentive_overview_and_liquidity/,2024-03-21 00:02:27,0.08944334650856389,0.3490683229813665,0.023,0.086,0.9919
Approaches for setting realistic price targets?,"I‘m having a hard time setting realistic price targets for my little coins and tokens when it comes to selling. The first levels that I started with got partially overrun much quicker than I thought.  
I mostly set 3 or 4 levels for each asset. I hold about 20 coins/tokens (yeah, ik ik, leave me alone) of which a few are only waiting to become break-even to be sold. But for some others I expect the last levels somewhere around their ATH. 
For the most part it just feels like picking random numbers that are based on gut feeling and a little anticipation of the rainbow chart.

Any approaches that might even include TA?

Historical Data Scanning/Screening for Crypto Pairs?,"Hey guys, im looking to investigate trading in crypto markets. I have plenty of familiarity with the general markets as someone who has been a crypto user for many years, however ive ran into a bit of a dilemma.

I want to deploy a strategy alongside a scanner/screener that will alert for me whenever certain volume, price, and market cap criteria are met. This sort of opportunistic approach to trading cryptocurrencies seems to be common, but how do you go about backtesting such a system if I dont know when my scanner alerted in the past?

Im looking for a scanner that offers DATE as an input parameter, so I can look at what my scanner would have outputted on a prior historical date. This sort of tool is surprisingly hard to come by. Even in stock trading I had to search quite hard to find this sort of tool, especially for a reasonable price. I already have historical charts, I just need to know what my scanner would have alerted.

The closest thing ive found so far that is helpful is [this CMC link](https://coinmarketcap.com/historical/) that provides basic price, market cap, and volume info on some historical dates. Purchasing/acquiring .csv time and sales data *might* be an option, however it will be difficult to work with (id have to sort through (and purchase) data for every single crypto pair), and is the worst case scenario. For comparison, I use [ChartMill](https://www.chartmill.com/stock/stock-screener) right now for stock trading (its truly an incredibly powerful tool, I highly recommend it for stock traders), im looking for something EXACTLY like this, except for coins. My last resort is to compile the data myself by just documenting my scanner alerts for the next few months...

"Crypto (defi) is turning mainstream, but not the way you think","Normally the argument I hear in crypto is that it needs to go mainstream for it to become fully successful. Mainstream to them is when everyone can easily use it, sorta like going on the internet and typing in you tube, and watching cat videos - (hurray the internet is now fully successful since your grandma can binge cat videos.)

But that's not how crypto will be unfortunately. Crypto will always be somewhat complicated and ""risky"" to every inexperienced person. And that's because crypto allows the ultimate low level access. Complete control of their assets. But the new emerging markets will be middle men services that will do this work for you, for a fee. It will evolve mainstream to the point where you can ""easily"" use crypto, but there will always be some ""fee"" unknown to the user. Just like moving coins from layer to layer, there will be services that do all this for you in the background, without you even having to know what the hell ""gas"" is.

Now I know you're thinking, oh shady exchanges do this for us right now. While that's true, these exchanges are mostly unregulated and can screw over many people. The future will be A LOT of regulation, but also utilizing native crypto blockchains frequently. It will be safer, more transparent, stable and a HUGE market!

Just like BlackRock announcing the future is tokenizing assets, just wait until your homes deed is a coin, and you pay someone to manage it.

So I recently got a new PC and I've just added MetaMask to that new machine.

On the old PC, I opened additional accounts besides the original ones to mess around with some BSC shitcoins, but now I can not find that account on top of the MetaMask. When I click on top to switch between accounts, it only shows the ""Account 1"" and the options to add others (add new, recover with private key or add a hardware wallet).

Does that mean if I don't have the private key to those other accounts, they're lost?

I don't remember what coins they were, probably dead, but I want to use this as a learning opportunity since I still keep most of my stuff on exchanges, and if it turns out I blew the accounts, there's a good reason to keep it that way...

Thanks in advance!

Is crypto currency really that bad for the environment in comparison to fiat?,"Full transparency I am not educated enough on the topic but when you dwell on everything that fiat currency requires to be manufactures and sustained, is it really a big environmental difference? 

I obviously used chatGPT to consolidate my thoughts but looking for insight.

 

1. **Resource Extraction**: Many materials used in currency production, such as paper and metals (like nickel, copper, and zinc), require mining operations. Mining can lead to habitat destruction, soil erosion, water pollution, and biodiversity loss. Additionally, the energy-intensive nature of mining contributes to greenhouse gas emissions.
2. **Manufacturing**: The process of manufacturing currency involves energy-intensive processes such as printing, engraving, and minting. These processes often require significant amounts of electricity and water, contributing to carbon emissions and water usage. Chemicals used in the printing and engraving processes can also pose environmental risks if not properly managed.
3. **Transportation**: Raw materials, equipment, and finished currency products need to be transported between various locations, including mines, production facilities, central banks, and commercial banks. Transportation emissions from vehicles, ships, and planes contribute to air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. This includes the transportation costs of the individuals doing these processes.
4. **Maintenance**: Currency circulation requires ongoing maintenance of infrastructure, including bank branches, ATMs, and currency processing facilities. This maintenance involves energy consumption for heating, cooling, lighting, and other operational needs. Additionally, the disposal of worn-out or damaged currency notes and coins can pose environmental challenges if not managed properly.
5. **Waste Generation**: Currency production generates waste materials such as paper scraps, metal shavings, and chemicals used in the manufacturing process. Proper waste management practices are essential to minimize environmental impacts and prevent pollution of landfills, waterways, and ecosystems.
6. **Energy Consumption**: The entire lifecycle of fiat currency, from resource extraction to circulation and disposal, consumes significant amounts of energy. Much of this energy comes from fossil fuels, contributing to climate change and air pollution.
7. **Water Usage**: Currency production, particularly paper currency, requires substantial amounts of water for pulp processing and printing. Water consumption can strain local water supplies and ecosystems, especially in regions already facing water scarcity or pollution challenges.",CryptoCurrency,https://reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1bjm6y3/is_crypto_currency_really_that_bad_for_the/,2024-03-20 15:35:16,0.03888067061143985,0.37095660749506904,0.066,0.052,0.0
The real meme coin winners and why retail is left holding the bags,"Meme coin season launched in full force these past couple of weeks attracting new users across multiple chains.

Some call it ultimate blockchain PVP, as it requires users to gamble on the meme token and flip it before other users (or Bots) dump the price 100%. 

BOME (BOOK OF MEME) made headlines as it hit $1B Marketcap in a day of launch, let's break down the top winners or ""traders.""

[To the insiders go the spoils](https://preview.redd.it/5pdljoz9wepc1.png?width=1205&format=png&auto=webp&s=10388a3cc8c4beed6b8e66f30561130afebb2b62)

Yep, the top 4 ""traders"" bought 0 BOME, but extracted $21M from retail. It's a great business being the creator of a massive popular Meme Coin. Now look at spots 5-6. These traders dropped $400k+ a piece on the token as the second layer of insiders and turned $4M plus each in profits.  No retail in sight. 

How do you get in early on a meme coin? You create it or be a close insider that is already rich or be an influencer on twitter that gets a free airdrop to pump n' dump on retail. Where does the first ""retail"" trader land (or the first trader to buy less than $10k)? Rank #68 with $8338 worth of BOME bought and sold for $872k

Well, what if you use screener tools and want to get in early? Here are some meme tokens created in the past hour

[Hint: they all go to zero, most dont last 30 minutes](https://preview.redd.it/7oas69o9xepc1.png?width=1561&format=png&auto=webp&s=ffd804e78612a704f5756be0e6375dae2dbe362f)

This is the other end of the spectrum from BOME. These are what I call the scalping meme coins that last 15m-1hr tops before the creator rugs the liquidity. The goal here is high action pvp, put $10 in and pull out for a quick $5-10 profit before the other guy rugs you.

SLERF is another popular memecoin atm with $400M market cap. No surprises to who the big winners are:

Another nefarious trend on Twitter is the notion of Pre-Sale, where users send their native token to an address listed in a tweet, hoping for a sweet airdrop. Millions of dollars have vanished to no surprise.

Does a crypto wallet like this even exist?," I'm interested in a wallet that functions exactly like a website page, with a social profile I guess? I made a quick sketch in photoshop.

Basically I'm interested in a simple webpage, where I can add a profile pic, name, a short bio and two or three crypto qr codes for different cryptocurrencies, to make payment simple and easy for anyone who visits it.

The profile pic, name and bio is a requirement, since it will be used in conjunction with other social media profiles and payment methods, and users need a simple non-technical way to know that they sent their money to the right guy.

And maybe if it has an option to connect metamask to the page it would be even better, to cover both mobile phone users and browser extension users.

Everywhere I've looked I only find browser extensions and they're not helpful at all :/

"What is the real cost of using Binance Convert to swap crypto? Binance say this Convert tool has no fees, but obviously Binance make their money by giving you a slightly worse price","The **Binance Convert** tool allows you to quickly convert one cryptocurrency to another.

Binance state that there are no fees for using this tool, but say that ""*every trade you make on Convert requires only a small spread in the corresponding Liquidity Pool*"".

But does anyone have any idea how much money you lose from this slightly worse price, as a percentage of the value of the crypto exchanged?

The normal fee Binance charges when you trade one cryptocurrency for another are 0.1% (or 0.075% if you pay your fees with BNB). How does the hidden cost of Binance Convert compare to this 0.1% fee?

Strump is a different and  wiser crypto coin investment ,"This is different than other coins of only for the next year. Strump will be tied to the passion of the ex-president's passionate base, and interest will rise as the election draws closer. What's more, once people learn that 0.8% of the supertrump.io wallet goes to Trump, and if enough people get involved this could even help with the insane fines imposed by on him by a sadly weaponized ""judicial"" system the dems are using as a the only way they know to slow him down. But everyone--even far the left--sees through this and cringes. 

The point is, there are very real world and very important events tied to this coin, and it is just a matter of time and publicity, and word catching on about Trump before this coin soars. This is the sort of concept coin that people will be kicking themselves not jumping in on this coin now.  Compared to all other meme coins which have no innate, massive fan case and built in donation component, the STRUMP coin makes more sense than any other coin out there--and certainly more sense than any meme coin.

Would you be interested in a P2P management app?,"I am creating a **free** web app for those who trade P2P or OTC. Primarily I was developing it for myself but then thought why not ask the community. Let me know what you think.  


**Problem statement:** P2P and OTC trading is not safe when fiat currency is involved. With strict corruption and anti-money laundering laws, banks can freeze your account at any time. If you haven't already been affected, consider yourself lucky. People have narrated their horror stories about how a seemingly straightforward crypto transaction resulted in the freezing of lifetime savings. This risk may be high or low depending on your country but it's there.

**Solution**: A bookkeeping software specially designed with crypto in mind. You would be able to trace down any given P2P transaction and store/retreive counterparty information. This would serve as documentary evidence that your link with the malicious counterparty was strictly transactional and you could forward the relevant information (id/phone etc) to the authorities.  
As a bonus, the app could also calculate taxes based on your transaction history.

A lot of these “decentraized” exchanges have back doors and use cache and centralized servers to store all the excessive data. Also, they sell governance coins that are useless. People buy them and never actually vote on anything, just hope they pump. What a circus it has all become. 

Not only are these smart contract cryptos struggling with the trilemma they are struggling to even run, looking at you Solana. 

It is time we focus on cryptoCURRENCIES that have never failed, and have a laser focus goal, to become a currency. This was the original goal of bitcoin - to not rely on a middleman like banks or a government to purchase goods. These smart contract coins are mucking the waters and have become a huge distraction. I believe there is room for at least 5 cryptos that focus solely on being a currency. 

I am guilty of falling for the trap of believing that smart contract coins will change the world. But after going through a couple of cycles, I have realized that the good old dependable cryptoCURRENCIES are tried and true and will continue to thrive. 

Would love to hear everyone’s thoughts.

"Don't get shaken out by selling your coins on this correction, the upside of a bullrun far outweights the losses now","Red days like this are painful to see for almost all of us, especially newer crypto investors who just entered the space. The rest who endured last bearmarket probably are numb to this.

Many are shocked by seeing their coins falling in price and maybe start to sell their coins in order to maybe rebuy later.

It could be a good strategy if you're a very good trader, but the common joe like me am better off by holding. Why?

First, the bullrun hasnt started yet...there will be at some point.

Second: nobody can exactly sell at a local top and rebuy at the exact local bottom

Third: at some point the market will pump back hard, if one has sold at a loss to rebuy later, you might wait too long to rebuy and 'lost' the total digit amount of coins, when you decide to reenter the market

Ofc, all of this only applies to ""good"" coins that can recover. The way to play the crypto casino is to hold strong during bullmarkets and picking the right coins at the right time.

Sellers might see themselves rescued from a -40% loss, but they can risk a upside of +10000% pump when the market decides to come back.",CryptoCurrency,https://reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1biin5b/dont_get_shaken_out_by_selling_your_coins_on_this/,2024-03-19 08:06:26,0.09429339477726574,0.4218202764976959,0.075,0.11,0.8936

Beginner's guide to Ethereum L2 (or how to save 99.9% in gas),"You may have heard a lot of talk about L2 these days and maybe you don't know what they are and are too afraid to ask or maybe you 'kinda' know what they are but not really sure how to use them.  People keep talking about crazy low fees and maybe you want to see how it works.

This guide will help you get started.

On edit: by beginner I don't really mean a crypto noob but rather someone who has been using Ethereum for years, has a hardware wallet, understands self custody, transactions, uniswap, metamask, etc but never used an L2.  For that person this is their beginner guide on switching to L2s.



# So what are L2?

L2 or Level 2 networks are a seperate blockchain which gains security from an L1 (in this case Ethereum) by passing information back to L1.  This provides a way to keep L2 validators honest and punish them for attempted bad actions.  In essence they are like a sidechain (i.e. Polygon) but with additional security.  In Polygon POS as unlikely as it is to happen if the validators of Polygon conspire against you to commit fraud there is nothing Ethereum can do.  It is an independent chain.  With L2 the rollups pushed up to Ethereum provide an irreversible canonical record and can be used to prove the fraud, reverse the fraudulent transactions, and financially damage those who engaged in the fraud.

L2 are also the future of scaling.  The Ethereum ecosystem today (not tomorrow or five years from now but today) using L2 can support at least 1,000 tps.  Every transaction made on L2 instead of L1 allows at least a 100x increase in throughput.  With further optimizations of rollups and refinements in the L1 a target of 10,000 tps is reasonable.  Once full danksharding is completed 100,000 tps are possible.

I am not going to go into the technical details of how and why as this post is already a small novel but I will do a deeper dive in another post.

# Wallet

You are going to need a cross chain wallet.  That is a single wallet that support Ethereum and Ethereum L2s (and optionally side chains and other compatible L1s).  In theory you have a lot of options but I am going to just say save yourself a lot of frustration and get Rabby.  Seriously night and day compared to metamask or ledger live (gag).

[https://rabby.io/](https://rabby.io/)

Rabby is open source and available as chrome extension, standalone desktop, and standalone mobile app versions.  If you have a hardware wallet device like ledger or trezor you can connect it to rabby.  Keys stay in the device, rabby is just the UI and a much better UI for dealing with L2.  One nice thing about rabby is it has an option to block metamask and redirect metamask requests to itself.  You can also turn this off and direct all requests back to metamask.  This means you can use it with dapps that don't support rabby natively by just clicking the metamask option in the dapp.

If you have a software wallet you can either create a new seed phrase for rabby as a trial run or import your existing seedphrase.  I know the later sounds scary so trial run it with a new seed phrase.  Remember never store seed phrase in any digital form. Analog (paper) offline form only.  

Honestly not sure why I farted about with metamask so long this is the next generation wallet for the future L2 driven world.  You can tell it was built to support L2 natively and not something hacked on as an afterthought.

Hard to list all the advantages of Rabby but here are just a few

* A unified cross chain token list.  It shows all your tokens across Ethereum and all L2s and uses little network icons on the token icons to make it clear.  If you want to see just one network you can click on the network icon and filter to just that network.  Unlike metamask it comes out of the box ready with every L2 that exists plus sidechains (polygon) plus every EVM compatible L1 (i.e. ada).
* Automatic switching between networks.  If you are on uniswap and switch from uniswap ethereum to uniswap Arbitrum the wallet will switch too.  This makes working across multiple networks a lot nicer.
* Easy way to block spam tokens/nfts from token views.
* Separates out all defi applications with summaries (i.e. everything you are lending at aave and everything you are borrowing).
* Support for whitelisting addresses and locking down transfers to only whitelisted addresses
* Ability to tag both sites and contracts as trusted or not.
* Provides various optional warnings on first used contracts, low trust contracts, and unknown contracts.
* Nice interface for revoking permissions and ability to batch revoke old permissions
* Create bookmarks of commonly used dapps and load the web page directly from the wallet.
* Transaction simulator to show you what executing a transaction will do before you do it

&#x200B;

Lots more honestly it is a great wallet and hands down the lowest friction most understandable way to get involved with L2.  Even if you aren't ready to switch to L2 it is a great wallet for Ethereum and you are L2 ready when you take the plunge.

# Centralized Exchange Onramps

If you are just interested in dipping your toe in to try things out before dealing with bridges honestly Centralized exchanges are the way to start.  Fees to get crypto into L2 are cheaper.  It works the same way as sending from your exchange account to your wallet except you pick the L2 as the network instead of Ethereum.  If you just want to try things out I recommend depositing $50 on one of the major exchanges and then withdrawing it as ETH to an L2.  Once on the L2 you can swap as you see fit.

I don't know the status of exchanges for non Americans but here are the big five in the US. I also included Polygon, BSC, and Solana withdraw fees for comparison. There is no L2 exchange support yet for common ERC-20 tokens such as WBTC, UNI, MKR, SUSHI, ZRX, MATIC, SHIB, PEPE, MKR, SNX.  Right now it is limited to ETH and stablecoins.

The prices are withdraw fees obviously deposits from L2 are free.  Prices converted to dollars for ease of comparison and for non-stablecoins will vary.  The ??.?? are for where a withdraw is available but I couldn't confirm a price it likely is similar to others at that exchange but didn't want to assume.  Crypto.com interface is just dogshit and I could only torture myself so long.

* E = Ethereum (I think you know this one)
* A = Arbitrum One (commonly just called Arbitrum)
* O = OP Mainnet (which has to be the dumbest/confusing name most people just call it 'Optimism')
* B = Base (L2 developed by team at coinbase)
* Z = zkSync Era (come on guys work on naming)

A couple things to note.  The first is that Arbitrum is the most widely supported.  Of the 5 major US exchanges 4 support Arbitrum, 4 support Optimism although sometimes with higher fees or less options, 2 support ZK Sync Era but only for ETH, only one supports Base.

The other thing to note is coinbase has impressively good fees for L2 withdraws.  Ethereum ranges from $0.01 to $0.29 and USDC is free.  Kraken and Crypto are way overcharging although still 80% less than Ethereum.   Kraken charging $12 for a zk sync era withdraw has to be a mistake.  Hey Kraken check your pricing.

# Which L2 to use?

Right now there are almost two dozen L2s and more projects being started up.

[https://l2beat.com/](https://l2beat.com/)

Four of the bigger ones right now are Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, and zKSync Era which are compared below.  


Transaction costs are going to vary depending on what transactions so I include fees for both a simple transfer of ETH between two addresses and a uniswap direct swap between two tokens. TVL from defilama is included to get an idea of defi activity on the chain.  Also included is ""TVL"" from l2beat but to avoid confusion I am going to call it ""TAV"" total asset value because having two different TVL is just confusing.  The TVL/TAV is useful to see how much stuff a chain has and thus the likelihood of finding assets to lend, borrow, or swap.  Note TAV includes ""idle"" assets while TVL is assets locked into defi protocols.  Average transactions per second over the last 7 days provides an indication of relative volume between chains.

**Ethereum (L1)**

    TAV: ~$720B ($450B ETH, $60B ERC-20 stablecoins, $210B non-stablecoin ERC-20 tokens)
    TVL: ~$46B
    dApps: 997
    tps: ~10 tps
    Eth transfer gas fee: ~$2.00
    Uniswap gas fee: ~$12.00

Pretty sure you know this one already.  Included for comparison.

&#x200B;

**Arbitrum** (officially ""Arbitrum One"")

    Technology:  Optimistic Rollup
    TAV: $16.2B
    TVL: $3.3B (20% of L1)
    dAPPS: 575 (58% of L1)
    tps: ~12 tps (120% of L1)
    Eth transfer gas fee: ~$0.03
    Uniswap gas fee: ~$0.09

The largest L2 by far in terms of TAV and TVL.  It now routinely has higher transaction volume than Ethereum.  It also boasts the largest CEX support and the most dapps.  If you don't know which chain to start on this is a solid first choice.  The transaction fees are slightly higher than other L2.  Not clear if this is due to demand or simply less optimization.  Fees are still >99% cheaper than Ethereum.  It has a TVL higher than any ""eth killer"" L1 chain.  Note the full name is actually Arbitrum One although some places will just call it Arbitrum.  There is a separate project Arbitrum Nova which is a ultra high speed low cost sidechain designed to niche applications where cost trumps security and decentralization. 

&#x200B;

**Optimism** (officially ""OP Mainnet"")

    Technology:  Optimistic Rollup
    TAV: $7.7B 
    TVL: $0.9B (6% of L1)
    dApps: 218 (22%  of L1)
    tps: ~6 tps (60%  of L1)
    Eth transfer gas fee: <$0.01
    Uniswap gas fee: <$0.01

Solidly the number two option.  Optimistic is behind Arbitrum so far in every metric except fees.  It impressively has very low fees even compared to other L2. A uniswap swap was <$0.01.  Routinely around 0.2 cents even for bridge or swap transactions. That is >99.98% cheaper than Ethereum.  You could do almost 5,000 swaps on Optimism for the cost of one swap on L1.

&#x200B;

**Base**

    Technology:  Optimistic Rollup
    TAV: $1.4B 
    TVL: $0.7B (4% of L1)
    dApps: 234 (23% of L1)
    tps: ~12 tps (120% of L1)
    Eth transfer gas fee: ~$0.01
    Uniswap gas fee: ~$0.01

The big claim to fame for base is it is supported by coinbase (base, coinbase get it).  Ties optimistic in low fees and has an impressive amount of dapps but only exchange supporting withdraws so far is coinbase.

&#x200B;

**zkSync Era**

    Technology:  zk Rollup
    TAV: $0.7B 
    TVL: $0.2B (1% of L1)
    dApps: 101 (10% of L1)
    tps: ~15 tps (150% of L1)
    Eth transfer gas fee: ~$0.01
    Uniswap gas fee: ~$0.04 (SyncSwap)

The only one of the big four using zk Rollups.  zk Rollups have a lot of long term potential but there are challenging making them EVM compatible and thus specific dapps may not currently be possible or require changes.  This has resulted in the lowest dapp numbers of the four and with it lower TVL/TAV.  Uniswap is not available but the comparable syncswap had $0.04 gas fee.  One advantage of zkRollups is when using the canonical bridge to move tokens back to L1 there is no delay.

# No seriously which L2 should I use?

**Right now if you haven't identified a specific need I would recommend Arbitrum as a first choice.**  The fees are slightly higher than other options (so 99% instead of 99.9% lower gas fees) but it has wide support in terms of tokens, dapps and exchange support.

# Bridges

Before messing about with bridges between L1 and L2 I strongly recommend getting setup with Rabby and transferring $20 to $50 of ETH from a CEX to an Arbitrum.  It is simpler and easier and you can get started very quickly with very little risk or stress.  However eventually you are likely going to want to move your ""stuff"" already on the L1 to an L2 in order to make future transactions cheaper.  

Your three options are:

**Use a CEX:** While not a bridge exactly using a CEX can be a lot cheaper.  As an example coinbase charges $0.01 to $0.29 for a withdraw to Arbitrum and deposits from the Ethereum network are obviously free.  This means a CEX can essentially be a low cost bridge.  Deposit your ETH/tokens to CEX from Ethereum network to the exchange's provided Ethereum address.  Once it clears then withdraw to your L2 address.

Pros: very cheap possibly free

Cons: limited to ETH and some stablecoins at this time

**Use a crosschain liquidity pool based bridge:** These work like uniswap liquidity pools but across chains.  They usually have a percentage fee in the 0.1% to 0.4% range and gas tends to be cheaper than canonical bridges.  If your token isn't available you will need to use a canonical bridge but worth checking out first.  Due to the % pricing if you have a large amount of assets (>$100k in a single token) it may be cheaper to use the canonical bridge.  Just like uniswap began with a few dozen tokens and exploded to thousands I expect the same will be true of liquidity bridges

Pros: more tokens supported, usually lower cost than canonical bridge if value is low

Cons: Limited by liquidity so may not be suitable for very large transactions

There are numerous bridges but three of the largest for supporting L2 are:

* Hop Protocol - [https://app.hop.exchange/](https://app.hop.exchange/)
* Rhino Finance - [https://app.rhino.fi/](https://app.rhino.fi/)
* Stargate - [https://stargate.finance/transfer](https://stargate.finance/transfer)

Hop Protocol is limited to ETH and stablecoins but tends to have fast performance and low gas fees.  It has some nice pools with token rewards for helping out.  The other two are more comprehensive supporting a large number of tokens and even supports bridging to sidechains and other L1s.

**Use the canonical bridge:** Every L2 has a bridge which is a part of the L2.  It is how assets become part of the L2.  Tokens are locked up on Ethereum and then an equal amount minted on the L2.  When bridging the other way the tokens on L2 are burned and then an equal amount unlocked on L2.

Pros: any ERC-20 token supported and exchanged at 1:1

Cons: usually the most expensive option due to L1 gas fees unless bridging a very high value ($100k+).

# How do I buy staking tokens and cold storage them on L2?

1. Deposit funds on a CEX which supports L2 withdraws
2. Once funds clear buy Eth
3. Withdraw to L2 of your choice (Arbitrum recommended)
4. Use a dapp like [https://curve.fi](https://curve.fi) to swap from ETH to STETH or WSTETH

# How do I trade shitcoins?

1. Deposit funds on a CEX which supports L2 withdraws
2. Once funds clear buy Eth
3. Withdraw to L2 of your choice (Arbitrum recommended)
4. Use a dapp like uniswap to swap ETH for shitcoins

Note: options may be limited but liquidity pools are building out on L2.  Check uniswap ahead of time so see if the token you are interested is available. Be sure to change uniswap network icon (upper right) to an L2.

# Do I need L2 tokens?

L2 tokens are only used for governance.  The gas on L2 is Eth just a lot less.  Your L2 wallet will need Eth to pay for gas so your first transfer should be Eth.  If you trap yourself Rabby wallet does have a gas fillup option. It comes with 20% fee ($20 of ETH for $24) but you can pay for it with any coin on another network.

# What about polygon?

Polygon POS (the chain you pay for gas with MATIC) is not an L2 it is a sidechain.  You can think of sidechains as a prototype version of L2.  As a sidechain polygon POS does not benefit form the security of Ethereum.  TVL/TAV for Polygon has been declining as people move funds to L2 which provide high tps and low fees but with the security of rollups to L1 (Ethereum).  Note if you currently have tokens on Polygon POS you may wish to just bridge them directly to an L2 instead of up to L1 and then to an L2.

# What is my address for L2?

That is the great part.  It is the same address as L1 (Ethereum) and the same on every L2.

# How do I pay for gas on an L2?
ETH is the gas for almost all L2.  So your first deposit/bridge/swap into an L2 should be ETH so now you have the gas you need.  Works just like Ethereum just 99.9% cheaper.  Right now gas prices on Arbitrum are 0.1 GWEI and on Optimism they are 0.0004 GWEI and on Ethereum they are 32 GWEI.

I believe this is because Stellar was designed and built specifically with tokenization and DEX features as the main focus. There are smart contracts and developer tools. All of this provides tons of power for DeFi.

Tokenization is the future of real world assets and there is an endless supply of physical things to tokenize and trade through the internet. Stellar is powered by XLM. When the value of tokenized assets explodes, will the value of XLM go up too? What do you think of this tokenized volume metric and the way it is visualized?",CryptoCurrency,https://reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1bjrei9/stellar_network_holds_the_largest_market_cap_of/,2024-03-20 19:07:44,0.05882936507936507,0.366170634920635,0.0,0.108,0.9195
150 Winner Giveaway Highlights and Results,"The Giveaway Period is Over, A Winning Number was Found, Winners were identified and Moons were sent. Lets Review the results!

>To determine the winning number, we will take the last 5 characters of the block hash of the first block mined on [Arbitrum one](https://arbiscan.io/) after the giveaway completes and convert it into [base-10.](https://www.thoughtco.com/definition-of-base-10-2312365) This creates a numerical range of 0-1048575, so in the case that the resulting number is over 1,000,000 we will use the subsequent blocks blockhash.

The First block after the giveaway was [Arbitrum Block #191877009](https://arbiscan.io/block/191877009). The last five of the hash was 6793d - when converted to base-ten, resulted in the winning number **424253**. The ending range was users who selected numbers between: **334,876 to 511,782.**

The one advantage alt-L1s have over L2s,"While I regularly sing the praises of Ethereum L2s over alt-L1s, there is one advantage L1s have over L2s, and that is the ability to fallback to social consensus, via hard forks, to fix software bugs.

An L2's security depends entirely on a smart contract deployed on L1. That smart contract in turn cannot be altered via a hard fork in the event that it malfunctions. 

This owes primarily to the position held by Ethereum stakeholders at large that the underlying Ethereum protocol must never be altered to fix third party smart contracts.

The insistence against hard forking for application-layer fixes is correct in my opinion, as it ensures a credibly neutral platform, but it does impose a cost on Ethereum L2 security and thus usability.

The proposition of tens, perhaps of hundreds, of billions of dollars worth of capital moving to an L2 is daunting, as it requires that much capital being at risk of loss from a smart contract flaw. The Rollup's layer 1 contracts are also complex pieces of software with many potential places that may contain hidden flaws capable of causing catastrophic losses.

So what can be done? Well the solution would be to create enshrined Rollups which are not third party smart contracts where it would be forbidden to burden the L1 network with a hard fork to fix.

The correct operation of enshrined Rollups would be protected by layer 1 social consensus, so a malfunction would be fixed via a mainnet hard fork.

This would protect Ethereum from catastrophic layer 2 malfunctions and encourage migration to layer 2, which would massively improve Ethereum user experience and adoption.

By designating the Rollup as enshrined, the implicit promise of a Layer 1 hard fork to rectify any flaws in the Layer 2 smart contract does not compromise Layer 1's credible neutrality. This is because such intervention would not stem from arbitrary decisions by the social layer to address issues in the third-party application layer, which could imply favoritism towards specific applications, users, or developers. Instead, it relies on a structured, predetermined consensus mechanism for managing problems in critical infrastructure.",CryptoCurrency,https://reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1bjeeuw/the_one_advantage_altl1s_have_over_l2s/,2024-03-20 10:12:34,0.05095238095238094,0.45345630559916267,0.103,0.167,0.9763
New UK crypto rules.,"T.L.D.R: I need the new rules the UK government have implemented for crypto.

So, I've recently had a big surge in price of a few assets I'm holding. So, I thought I'd take some of those gains and invest in a few new projects before the Bull kicks off. To start with, I unstaked my SOL on my Hot Wallet and swapped for a bunch of stable-coins, in anticipation of swapping them for new assets. Upon finishing swapping, I tried to re-stake the majority of my SOL again. Only to be told that I can no longer stake through my wallet. OK, I though, fair enough, I had heard about a few new rules introduced in the UK. That's shitty, but I'll cope. So, I transferred the stabecoin to my Phantom wallet and tried to swap the balance for the project that I was interested in, Only to be met with: ""This feature is not available in your country"". This was really annoying, as I've just lost my staking ability to try and get these new tokens. So, my question is: Is there a place I can see all the new rules that the UK has implemented. I've searched for them, but all I get is vague articles telling me nothing. Even the UK's .gov site doesn't seem to even be sure what the new rules are. This is infuriating.",CryptoCurrency,https://reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1bjj2h7/new_uk_crypto_rules/,2024-03-20 13:27:05,0.018939393939393947,0.5237794612794614,0.072,0.079,0.0

Capital gains tax,"Is anyone familiar with capital gains details I'm the following scenario: 
>To exploit an arbitrage opportunity in the south korean crypto market, crypto is bought in a cheaper foreign market, sent to a domestic Korean crypto exchange account, sold for fiat, then transferred to a korean bank, then from that bank transfered abroad. 

In this scenario, how are capital gains calculated, (namely, crypto deposited into an exchange account without verifiable value as it was purchased in a foreign market makes determining the amount of capital gains arbitrary)?

"MIcrostrategy thinks their loans are helping BTC. But actually the loans are likely insurance agreements for institutions shorting BTC for billions of dollars, at the expense of MSTR shareholders.","The loan terms are that if the BTC price goes up, then the loan can be converted into MSTR stock which is basically a form of BTC for an agreed upon price, basically similar to a call option.

If the price goes down then the loan is kept as dollars, and must be repaid at some point, including potentially liquidating all of MSTR BTC holdings for cash to repay the dollar loans.

The interest rate is nearly nothing.

So the question is who would spend hundreds of millions/billions buying these types of call options?

Companies actually bullish on BTC can just buy some or use the ETF/actual-futures. However its actually quite difficult to find a safe way to short BTC without the risk of unlimited upside.

MSTR comes along and solves this problem, he doesnt need to pay much interest since the terms of the loans are so bad for MSTR holders, that these shorters are more than happy to make it seem like they are lending money, but really are purchasing insurance for their massive shorts, at the expense of MSTR shareholders.

**TLDR:**

>1) Company shorts BTC for billions

>2) Company lends money to MSTR and receives a deal:

>A) BTC goes up, their loan is converted to BTC. 

>B) BTC goes down, the debt is dollars.

>3) MSTR shareholders

>A) BTC goes up, they make a little bit of money, but the rest goes to the lenders. 

>B) BTC goes down, the shareholders lose potentially everything.

How are 12 words considered secure then when it's so much less than 160bit? I read that something gets stored as 128bit numbers. 128bit is actually less than 50 dice rolls, so that would make at least some sense.

And how come that 160bit is actually so much less than the number of atoms in the universe? I was always told that there are more addresses than atoms.

I own a small pool of BTC and the more I learn the more I’m intrigued (standard sentiments I’m sure).

However, I’m eager to read more works on crypto, the theory behind it, and practical applications.

State of multi-sig hardware wallets,"Someone close to me recently got their house broken into and their seed phrase stolen from their safe. This got me thinking about the single point of failure of today's devices.

 [Block's Bitkey ""Hardware Wallet"" will Violate your Privacy and Security (zherbert.com)](https://www.zherbert.com/bitkey/) 

Is there a company that does multi-sig hardware wallets correctly? Ideally: 

1. 2-of-4 multisig where 1 code lives on a hardware device, 1 offline on paper, 1 on a connected device (phone/pc) and 1 at a friend's place. This allows for security and recovery options. 2 codes needed for a transaction or to recover any other code.
2. No cloud service for privacy.
3. Ease of use with mobile app + hardware device.
4. Open source mobile/desktop app
5. A hardware device with a screen to not depend on the internet connected device for security
6. Ideally air gapped device.
7. Ability to export all keys so no company/app dependencies in case they go out of business.

Bitcoin emerged as a technology out of necessity. After the 2008 Financial Crisis an intelligent generation became aware that the money we based our economy on was headed for the same fate as every currency from every economy in history: a complete devaluation. Bitcoin is the solution to that.

That is why we are here, thats what this is all about. ATH's, 20% corrections, halving cycles, they're all rounding errors in the end anyways right? DCA, HODL, secure your coins, and go live your life. Quit price watching and quit predicting.

Here are my questions;
1. Is requesting a fee for a KYC verification normal? There is nothing posted on the site about needing to pay this fee.
2. Is restricting accounts & then stating I need to pay another fee normal? They do not on the site have information on daily minimum withdrawals & then locking or restricting the account & until another fee is paid to unrestrict the account. 

Side note: I don't know how I will pay for this new fee.

3. I've been told I cannot use the funds/BTC sitting in the account to pay any fees. The funds for fees have to be added to the account separately. The do not have anything posted to their site with this information, they just send it by email after I try to do it. Why would they have such a rule? 

Please help me figure this out. My bills are piling-up & I'm very stressed out by this entire situation.

Mining Bitcoin with Poop,"I was reading about the Omni-processor which converts human waste into drinking water plus electricity. I learned the best models can generated 250 kw of electricity which is enough to generate .15 bitcoin per day.

It seems to me that this would be a great way to promote Bitcoin mining in the continents of Africa as well as India because both regions have major sanitation problems. The local could get clean water and they would have an incentive to collect poop and feed it to the generator cuz it would generate bitcoin which would provide jobs to the local economy while promoting Bitcoin.

I can't see the downside but I'm wondering why no one is doing this yet? Seems to me that if we can turn our shit into jobs & bitcoin everyone would win.

Bitcoin and AI,"Hi. I was thinking about the future of bitcoin and AI, and I thunked up a spooky idea.  What if bitcoin is the main tool that AI can use to control us?

Here’s my chain of thinking…

Bitcoin uses a lot of energy, and so does data centers that power AI (it’s one of the main future constraints). These may be seen as a competitors for energy, however perhaps they actually enable and measure one another. AI compute will be exchanged for bitcoin, and bitcoin will be exchanged for AI compute. AI needs physical energy for its digital work, and bitcoin is the mechanism for AI to exchange its digital work for physical work. 

Here’s how it will start….bitcoin will at first be used to add electrical load buffer to the data centers and the electrical grid, as we are seeing in Texas.  This will make data centers more robust and flexible. And, AI developers will also find it useful to make and receive payments by bitcoin (maybe the lightning network) because payments are nearly instant and irreversible, which is critical for fast speed AI business. Further, bitcoin will also capture the appreciating economic productivity gains of AI because it’s a deflationary currency. This makes it perfect for AI to hold as a store of value for itself. Additionally, governments and militaries will find it important to mine bitcoin and hold bitcoin, so in the event of a war, they can use the bitcoin to pay miners to transfer energy to the data centers to compute critical military AI calculations. 

All of this is bullish for bitcoin and the price going up.


However, now if you imagine AI becoming evil, where it becomes used as a means of centralization and control, this could be possible through bitcoin. Because bitcoin is a way where digital work from AI can be exchanged for physical work of bitcoin mining and physical energy, it represents a way in which AI can exchange its digital work for control and ownership upon the physical world. At first I imagined a scenario where some renegade AI developer programs their AI to influence and manipulate humans, and then controls their overall social behavior. However, now I can further imagine where a rogue AI program can become wealthy by accruing its own bitcoin, business power, and bribe human officials through bitcoin payments. This was not as likely under the fiat system because the control of fiat was largely centralized with the central banks and governments. But now, bitcoin is a decentralized currency, and the threat of a centralized and corrupt AI could leverage bitcoin for its own nefarious means.

Mixing KYC with non KYC," Sorry if this is a stupid question, I took a look at some similarly titled ones and couldn't find an answer. I’ve been buying up BTC since 2021, and throughout that time, the majority of my Bitcoin has been bought through exchanges with KYC - either coinbase or a Singapore based one called Onus. I’m from the UK and currently an expat living abroad in Southeast Asia. During this time I was initially buying on coinbase through my UK bank account. 

After a while I wanted to buy some BTC with some of my money abroad, but I had issues with most exchanges that were blocked by my local bank. Eventually I was able work out how to buy P2P (also with KYC) through Onus. Before I figured this out however, I asked a friend of a friend out here to send me about £1000 worth of USDT and I transferred the money to his bank account. I exchanged this for Bitcoin and I transferred it to my trust wallet, where it mixed with my KYC Bitcoin .. did I make a mistake here?

I’ve become worried that now if I ever try to sell in the UK through coinbase, it could all get blocked / frozen if they can’t trace the origin of some of it. Would they freeze the non KYC and let me have the rest, or would I be okay? I’m not sitting on masses here, around 0.12 total. It’s also worth mentioning that a lot of the Bitcoin I bought through Onus, I sent to kucoin to exchange because the fees were lower - and this was before kucoin had KYC.

Moving BTC off Ledger (sat / byte vs sat / vbyte),"So I'm in the process of moving funds to a different wallet from Ledger Live.

Ledger Live quotes the fee in sat / byte. Currently it's saying for a low transaction fee I have to pay 26 sat / byte however I can submit a custom fee.

The bitcoin in my current wallet have are all stored in addresses starting with 'bc1' (i.e. segwit I assume)

On [bitcoinfees.net](https://bitcoinfees.net) it's currently saying a fee of 15 sat / vbyte will take about 20 mins.

I don't fully understand the difference between sat / vbyte vs sat / byte and the last thing I want is for the transaction to get stuck. For the purposes of moving funds to the new wallet can I assume sat / vbyte is analogous to sat / byte in my case? I.e can I go to advanced on Ledger Live and select say 15 sat / byte and it's likely to adhere to the 20 mins according to bitcoinfees or can I not make that assumption.

Bitcoin Power Law model,"You can Google ""Bitcoin Power Law"" or search on  YouTube or use MS Copilot to get more details but I find this to be an interesting model.

It isn't meant to be used for day trading (it's not that specific) but I think it might be helpful to look ahead over the next 20 years (with all the caveats implied with forecasting the future).

It projects a price along with a support price and a resistance price which is basically one standard deviation so you have a price, double the price for the resistance and half the price for the support price.

It shows the greatest absolute gains between year 10 and year 20. It shows declining percentage gains with it currently gaining (as I recall) about 45%, going to the 30% range at year 10 and 19% at year 20.

I could be helpful just planning ahead, it could also put the blow off tops in perspective and give a clue as to how long it's likely to go at any point in time.

You can also plug the formula into an Excel spreadsheet. The formula is Price = 10\^-17 \* (days since Genesis block in Jan 3, 2009...current figure is 5557)\^5.8.

It basically shows a price of about $100k by the end of 2025 with resistance at $200k and support at $50k. That's for one standard deviation. In the past it has gone to 2 standard deviations for short periods of time (again, as I recall).

Those figures would be in line with what has occurred in the past. Maybe this time is a little different with the spot ETF so maybe the numbers are moved earlier. Usually the ATH occurs after the halving and the peak usually happens 12-18 months after the halving. That would put it toward the end of 2025.

Some say that this time all that might occur by the end of the year (2024) and that there might be a crash next year. I tend to think that next year will still be a good year even if this year is a good year as well.

You'll see that $1,000,000 Bitcoin could happen by 2028 and will ""never"" get below $1,000,000 after 2037.

Bitcoin assumptions may be off?,"I'm into Bitcoin for the long-term and I'm ""heavily"" invested. However, there are a few common assumptions regarding Bitcoin that I'm not too sure about.

Many people plan their investing around the 4 year cycle and the halving. I understand the reasons why but there are several basic concepts in investing that generally hold true. One is that nothing is especially predictable other than a long upward trend in general (even that isn't guaranteed).

Once a pattern is deemed to be profitable then arbitrage generally  collapses that pattern. The 4 year cycle of Bitcoin is based on 3 data points. That's not statistically significant.

The halving reward is minor enough at this point that it's not really all that significant given the current daily volume. It may be a small factor but at this point I don't think it's especially significant.

I think that it's more likely that with a larger market cap that Bitcoin will begin to act like any other asset in that it won't be especially predictable and that while it will go up and down over time, it won't be confined by a 4 year cycle.

There is one view, with some logic behind it, that the cycle will be shorter this time since the gains are coming earlier, before the halving and that it has been priced in and that the gains will be higher this time due to the spot ETFs but that the down cycle will begin in early 2025.

As I said, there is some ""logic"" there but it still assumes the 4 year cycle. Maybe that is the way it will play out but I think eventually there won't be 4 year cycles and that there will just be indeterminate up and down years just as with any other asset. I may be wrong as well, of course.

My approach though is going to be to assume that it will behave more like most other assets. I'm not going to focus on ""crypto spring, summer, fall, winter"" and I'm not going to focus on the ""halving"".

I'll not sell most of my Bitcoin, especially for ""timing"" reasons and if I do sell some (never all) it will be for specific purposes. I'm older so it's not about buying a house (I already have one) but it may be to have a larger cash reserve (yes, even debased fiat is necessary currently) or to invest more in stocks if stocks are low and Bitcoin is becoming too large a percentage of my assets.  Even though stocks aren't likely to have returns as great as Bitcoin, to me, it's still a prudent thing to do (some diversification).

Otherwise, my ""advice"" to anyone is to buy and don't sell (with the above exceptions). If I was young, I would be going all in with Bitcoin until I had substantial assets in Bitcoin. I'd put half in a Roth account and half in a taxable account. I'd do this before I started thinking about buying a house.

The longer you can put off buying a house, starting a family, the more likely you are to end up with a standard of living that is above ""average"". It's easy to be average. There is nothing exceptional about being young, getting married, having kids, paying for childcare, mortgages, minivan payments and complaining that the ""American Dream"" is expensive. That's not the path toward ""success"". Be different.

Work hard for at least 10 years and put everything into Bitcoin. Do that and you'll have more choices in life, you won't have to complain about the government, Boomers, things not being ""fair"" or ""affordable"". You won't have to worry about the ""rich"" or the ""greedy"" corporations.

Don't do that and you will be average (shudder):)

Common nocoiner fallacies: Bitcoin isn't money because,"**Because it isn't backed by anything.**

Answer: No fiat currency is backed by anything. Precious metal backing of currencies ended many years ago.

**Because the dollar is backed by a powerful military and Bitcoin isn't**

Answer: Backing referred to the convertability to gold and silver. A military isn't backing a currency and many of the 100+ fiat currencies don't have a powerful military behind them.

**Because it is volatile**

Answer: Both the Turkish Lira and the Argentine Peso are very unstable and volatile and they are still considered to be money. Both Turkey and Argentina are G20 nations.

**Because it doesn't have an intrinsic value**

Answer: No fiat currency has an intrinsic value.

**Because it's just zeros and ones in a database**

Answer: Most of fiat money is just an entry in a database.

**Because it is created out of nothing**

 I was very surprised that the mainstream media channel did a very good job at explaning what Bitcoin is and who might be Satoshi. Very unbiased and no false claim and no mixing Bitcoin with ""cryptos"". 

At the end of the news story, my captain and 2 other firefighters asked me a bunch of questions about Bitcoin. They want in. I calmed them down, not trying to orange pill them, suggested more reading, education, etc. 

They know im in because they see me read a lot of books about Bitcoin and they used to make fun of me. Now they want to learn a little. I dont think they're ready to be true Bitcoiners. I know that if they buy, they're not gonna have the conviction to hodl. 

The seed has be planted, we buy Bitcoin at the price we deserve. I have been DCAing Bitcoin for a while and they know. They were surprised to learn that the price went back up to its ATH, they thought it was dead because of all the bad news about BTC that you always see on MSM.

Anyway, goodnight, stay safe and dont orange pill your entourage, plant the orange seed.

How much did you borrow?

To pay for what?

What’s your interest rate and repayments? 

During the life of the loan how much did your bitcoin appreciate?

How much did you actually pay the bank in the end? 

And did how much you paid in repayments end up being less than your bitcoin appreciation?

Noob questions,"I am pretty new to bitcoin investing. I started about a year ago on Robinhood (since then I’ve been reading it’s not a great option). I recently bought a Trezor but am waiting for it to be delivered (should be here Monday). My plan is to HODL which is why I bought it. I was going to try and transfer to a hot wallet (any recommendations for best one would be appreciated) but at this point feel like it’s kind of pointless with the Trezor coming on Monday.

I have a few questions:

1. Am I able to transfer btc directly to my Trezor or do I need to use another service like a hot wallet?

2. Are there fees to make a transfer to a cold wallet?

3.  I am planning on setting up the cash app direct deposit to DCA to avoid fees. I understand it’s recommended to transfer to cold wallet once you have a good amount of sats. Can you transfer directly from cash app to Trezor? What would be the recommendation of the amount of sats to save in cash app before putting on cold wallet? 

4. Since most people aren’t a fan of buying on Robinhood (high fees I think?), would Kraken be a better option when buying larger amounts? Or just stick to cash app? Specifically I’m talking about when I have an extra lump sum of money to invest. My understanding of the way you avoid fees buying on cash app is having a direct deposit set up and getting paid partially in btc. 

5. Sort of a tax related question if anyone has any idea… I had bought a good amount about a year ago and planned to sell at $60k. I ended up selling at $55k because I got scared then regretted the choice and bought everything back. This was really stupid because I ended up losing money with the Robinhood fees and now I’m wondering if I will have to pay taxes on my gains (even though I reinvested right back into btc the next day). Anyone had something similar happen or know if paying taxes on that money is a thing? 

Thanks for taking the time to read. I’ve been really enjoying learning about bitcoin and am excited to be apart of the community here. I appreciate everyone’s insight!

How Often Do Y’all Check the Price of Bitcoin,"A BTC noob here and I hope I’m accepted. I only just recently invested in the ETF, and don’t plan (for now) on ever holding any BTC on an exchange or a cold wallet. I do however think that making a substantial investment in my Roth should pay dividends. A few observations:

Contrary to what my friends and families would have had me believe, my account did not plummet to zero a few days after buying. It’s been a trip watching these large swings (albeit most likely smallish from a historical perspective) in my brokerage account.

A few questions:

-How often do you check the value of BTC? On the large green days it’s so much fun to root for and watch. 
-How do you manage the high highs and low lows for a mental POV? 
-Is everyone here a HODLer or do many people take profits? 
-If you’re in an ETF, is there a set point where taking profits is advisable in a tax privileged account or should I just set it and forget it like my total market funds. 

Also wondering if you have any podcasts or YouTubers that are actually worth following. 

Thanks all!

could access to bitcoin be restricted?,"I have been in this sub for quite a while and reading the posts seems like mass adoption is on it's way. I used to think that too, btc is like gold but 10× better: why would anyone not want to use it? 

But then, yesterday while trying to sleep, the mass adoption narrative started appearing to me like a fairy tale. If btc really became of global use the elites and governments would start seeing it as a very big threat.

What would stop the elites from taking an unitary action and banning all popular means of acquiring btc? (i am talking about an aperation between the biggest nations) The market really depends on the very big exanges (such as coinbase, binance etc.). The regual Joe when trying to buy some sats the first thing he does is signing up to an exange. But what if all exanges were banned, or access to it restricted? Would the mass adoption narrative still be possible?

Picture milions upon milions of people trying to buy btc; i think that very big exanges (with thousands of btc to sell and very big servers) would be necessary for mass adoption. Or think about where would you sell your btc if those services were restricted or banned.

Of course there would still be means of acquiring/selling btc, maybe using a vpn, maybe using the dark web or even P2P; but that's not something the regular joe knows how to do, the regular joe does not want to get into truble with the government. Also, let's all remember also how governments decided they didn't want nuclear power, and every one went whith it, or how they went with killing millions just beacuse of the sake of it; my point is that masses are really easly manipulable. 

So, my question being, if the elites decided they had enough, would they be able to prohibit people from acquiring btc in an efficent way (taking into account good part of the population using the service)?

Bitcoin Marketplace(s)?,"So many people view Bitcoin as a store of value and not much more (which is fine, to each their own, and maybe this is actually true). Others view it as the long-term solution to currency. I think one of the big obstacles to the second point of view, being a currency, is the issue of the world's general acceptance of the technology as a viable means to exchange goods. I'm somewhere in the middle, I guess. It's obviously a great store of value in either case, but I also see its potential in replacing (or at least running parallel to) fiat.

In order to gain the world's acceptance, or at least a larger portion of the world, steps must be taken to demonstrate its ability as a currency... it won't just happen. With the onset of layer 2 and any potential future layer 3 plans, the first step has certainly been taken. Transactions on layer 1 are likely to be reserved for huge purchases (I'm thinking cars and real estate or stuff like that). Layer 2 exists for smaller scale purchases (like everyday goods), but how often is it used? And where? Are there online marketplaces built for layer 2 buying, like a bitcoin version of eBay or Craigslist? I'm a software/web developer by profession, and I wonder if it would be worth it to try to create such a simple platform for this to help us take the 2nd step in all this. I don't know the legalities with allowing users to sell online, but I'd imagine the red tape would be slightly thinner since Bitcoin is unregulated (unlike fiat). A user could simply send the sats via layer 2 (or optionally layer 1 if it's a big purchase), and then the seller just sends the thing. It seems as legit as Craigslist and eBay anyway... built on trust that the seller sends the goods. I'm expecting a lot of platforms like this to pop up, and I think they'd be beneficial to the general outreach of bitcoin users, and probably would get non-hodlers to learn more about the technology, potentially convincing them to buy some sats themselves.

What do other people think about this in general? A more useful online presence seems like a logical way to spread the good word.

Why I’m Choosing to Build My Service on Bitcoin: The Future of Decentralization,"My first job after college was in the sourcing and trading department of a garment manufacturing and trading company. My responsibilities included placing orders with fabric manufacturers primarily in China, Taiwan, and Southeast Asia, overseeing their shipping schedules, and finalizing payments after each shipment.

Whenever I had to make a payment to our partner manufacturers, I was required to open a Letter of Credit (L/C) at a local bank. L/Cs are commonly used in international trade, especially for large contracts, as they provide a trust mechanism between parties who typically do not know each other. By involving banks as intermediaries, trust is established through a third party.

For instance, as a producer, once you open an L/C at a bank, it acts as your counterparty, guaranteeing payment for your shipment regardless of what happens to the cargo or buyer. This payment is usually settled within 60 to 90 days. Your bank then coordinates with your buyer's local bank to collect the funds. Even in adverse events like a buyer defaulting, the bank can still recover some amount due to the L/C insurance.

However, L/Cs, despite facilitating international trade, are incredibly slow, often taking 90 days or longer to process payments. The bureaucracy involved in requesting an L/C is also cumbersome, involving extensive paperwork, strict banking hours, and the additional challenge of dealing with uncooperative bank staff.

Given today's global connectivity, where face-to-face meetings can easily be arranged in person or via Zoom, the necessity of L/Cs in every international trade transaction seems outdated. It raises the question of whether personal visits to partner factories or starting with smaller, test orders might be more effective ways to establish trust without the need for bank intermediaries.

My conviction is that trust in trade should be built directly between parties, rather than outsourced to third parties like banks or governments, whose reliability has increasingly come into question, especially after the covid pandemic.

This belief prompted my shift to the crypto industry. I saw #Bitcoin  as a revolutionary technology that could redefine trust when people recognize the value of self-reliance. In an era of diminished governmental and financial authority, individuals should have the freedom to invest, send money, and conduct transactions across borders with minimal regulatory constraints.

This is why I founded my business four years ago—to empower individuals worldwide to increase their wealth through technology and cryptocurrency, unbounded by geography or governing bodies. #Bitcoin  offers a vision of a world where anyone can engage in financial activities with anyone else, a cause worth dedicating myself to.",Bitcoin,https://reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1bkoagc/why_im_choosing_to_build_my_service_on_bitcoin/,2024-03-21 22:09:20,0.03945578231292517,0.3360544217687075,0.005,0.134,0.9946

Look at us now.,"A specter is haunting the modern world, the specter of crypto anarchy.

Computer technology is on the verge of providing the ability for individuals and groups to communicate and interact with each other in a totally anonymous manner. Two persons may exchange messages, conduct business, and negotiate electronic contracts without ever knowing the True Name, or legal identity, of the other. Interactions over networks will be untraceable, via extensive re-routing of encrypted packets and tamper-proof boxes which implement cryptographic protocols with nearly perfect assurance against any tampering. Reputations will be of central importance, far more important in dealings than even the credit ratings of today. These developments will alter completely the nature of government regulation, the ability to tax and control economic interactions, the ability to keep information secret, and will even alter the nature of trust and reputation.

The technology for this revolution--and it surely will be both a social and economic revolution--has existed in theory for the past decade. The methods are based upon public-key encryption, zero-knowledge interactive proof systems, and various software protocols for interaction, authentication, and verification. The focus has until now been on academic conferences in Europe and the U.S., conferences monitored closely by the National Security Agency. But only recently have computer networks and personal computers attained sufficient speed to make the ideas practically realizable. And the next ten years will bring enough additional speed to make the ideas economically feasible and essentially unstoppable. High-speed networks, ISDN, tamper-proof boxes, smart cards, satellites, Ku-band transmitters, multi-MIPS personal computers, and encryption chips now under development will be some of the enabling technologies.

The State will of course try to slow or halt the spread of this technology, citing national security concerns, use of the technology by drug dealers and tax evaders, and fears of societal disintegration. Many of these concerns will be valid; crypto anarchy will allow national secrets to be trade freely and will allow illicit and stolen materials to be traded. An anonymous computerized market will even make possible abhorrent markets for assassinations and extortion. Various criminal and foreign elements will be active users of CryptoNet. But this will not halt the spread of crypto anarchy.

Just as the technology of printing altered and reduced the power of medieval guilds and the social power structure, so too will cryptologic methods fundamentally alter the nature of corporations and of government interference in economic transactions. Combined with emerging information markets, crypto anarchy will create a liquid market for any and all material which can be put into words and pictures. And just as a seemingly minor invention like barbed wire made possible the fencing-off of vast ranches and farms, thus altering forever the concepts of land and property rights in the frontier West, so too will the seemingly minor discovery out of an arcane branch of mathematics come to be the wire clippers which dismantle the barbed wire around intellectual property.

Arise, you have nothing to lose but your barbed wire fences!

Where To Put Bitcoin If Not In a Cold Wallet?,"I convinced a close friend to purchase a sizable portion of Bitcoin before the halving. She is the most technologically illiterate person in the world (self-proclaimed) and does not like the idea of a cold wallet, no matter how many times I've insisted upon it.

Obviously, we can all agree a cold wallet is ideal but that's not going to happen. Is there a favorite among the online wallets that's better than just letting the Bitcoin sit in Robinhood/coinbase?

Understanding market cap and why it’s a fugazi. ,"
For those who might be new to Bitcoin, it’s important to understand what market cap actually is…

Market capitalization (or market cap) is something you’ll hear a lot about when it comes to BTC and other coins. It’s a number that’s calculated by multiplying the last traded price x the outstanding supply. So if a coin has a supply of 1 million and the price is currently $10, the current market cap  is $10 million. It’s constantly fluctuating in line with price. 

This $10 million figure doesn’t mean every coin is worth $10, nor does it mean that $10 million has been invested. It doesn’t represent actual money - it’s a fugazi.

 I’d argue the $ symbol shouldn’t be used to denote market cap at all. 

 I could launch a coin with a supply of 1 million today, sell 1 coin to a friend for $10, and suddenly I own 99.99% or a crypto that has a market cap of $10 million. Only $10 was invested, and if I tried to sell all my coins for $10 each, the price would instantly collapse to 0. 

One of the main reasons FTX collapsed so quickly,  and SBF’s “net worth” was lost overnight is because it was all tied to the market cap and price of the FTX token. SBF was never a billionaire in real terms, no more than I’d be a multi millionaire in the above example. 

The only way market cap is useful is so 1 cryptocurrency  can be benchmarked against another. Most have different outstanding supplies so this provides an easy way to compare and rank.

Market cap is a function of price, not the other way around, and there is no “cap” on  how high something can go.
 

Next time you read an article saying BTC or other coins can’t reach x value because the market cap would be too high, or worth more than all the money in the world etc, remind yourself that market cap doesn’t represent money or value, it’s just a number.

"Serious Issue with Coinbase, Missing Transfer After Account Review","Hi guys, I’m facing a serious issue with Coinbase and could really use your advice.  

On March 9, I transferred USDC from BlockFi to Coinbase. Immediately following the transfer, my Coinbase account was conveniently put ""under review."" Despite BlockFi confirming the transaction as successful, the funds were inaccessible due to the review status on Coinbase.

 I contacted Coinbase support, underwent a thorough verification process, and was assured that the pending transaction would be credited once the review was lifted. The account review was eventually lifted, but my funds were still missing. 

 Repeated attempts to resolve this issue have led me down a frustrating path of unfulfilled promises and lack of updates. Each time I've contacted Coinbase, I've been told that my case was escalated to the email support team, with assurances that I would be updated shortly. 

 Each time I reach out, hoping for some actual progress, I'm met with the ""we'll get back to you"" line. And if that’s not frustrating enough, conversations end abruptly, like they’re racing to catch the last bus out of town, leaving me hanging mid-sentence.

Here I am, stuck with my funds in limbo and feeling like I'm just chasing shadows. This whole ordeal has been a marathon of frustration, and the silence from Coinbase is like salt in the wound.

Has anyone else encountered this missing funds situation and been ghosted this hard by coinbase  support ?  

&#x200B;

 TL;DR: Transferred USDC from BlockFi to Coinbase on March 9, and my Coinbase account was immediately placed under review, blocking access to the transferred funds. Despite BlockFi confirming success and Coinbase lifting the review after verification, my funds are still missing. Multiple contacts with Coinbase support have only led to promises of escalation with no follow-up or resolution.

"No, it's not great irony to measure Bitcoin's value in fiat","I've seen a couple popular posts/comments implying it is ironic or contradictory to measure Bitcoin's value in fiat. I wanted to broadcast some thoughts in response:

The fiat price of Bitcoin is merely a proxy to quantify Bitcoin's value. Fiat, for all its flaws, is currently the universal language of money, it's a convenient, granular, familiar and easy to understand unit of account - the measuring stick for economic value. Imagine trying to gauge Bitcoin’s value in, say, barrels of oil or ounces of gold. Sure, it sounds cool and apocalyptic, but it’s not exactly convenient for day-to-day comprehension.

Now, for the real mind-bender: measuring Bitcoin's value in a depreciating fiat might actually highlight Bitcoin’s strength. If Bitcoin's price in fiat skyrockets faster than fiat’s own inflation or depreciation, isn't that a neon sign flashing Bitcoin’s increasing value? It implies the same stack of Bitcoin can now be exchanged for greater goods and services. What's not to celebrate about that?

In a world where fiat is the ruler, Bitcoin is the revolution measuring its conquests in the current language of the people. So, the next time you see someone celebrating Bitcoin's rising value in fiat, remember, it's not a contradiction. It's a testament to its unstoppable rise.",Bitcoin,https://reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1bk3jr1/no_its_not_great_irony_to_measure_bitcoins_value/,2024-03-21 06:40:00,0.1851851851851852,0.46929012345679005,0.064,0.182,0.9766

IRS declaration - questions regarding tax on crypto gains in Portugal,"Hello everyone,

I think this post might be interesting to some of you as I believe many still consider Portugal crypto friendly.

I've had a look at the IRS tax forms for 2023 where they added the field for crypto gains. I also consulted with a couple of accountans. Now I have serious doubts about how favourable the local tax regime is towards crypto gains.  
  
Everyone says that profit from crypto sales goes to annex G or G1 depending on whether you held your crypto for 365 days before selling. However, both forms request you to write the Portuguese NIF (tax identification number) of Entitade Gestora which is your broker or a centralised exchange. As far as I know, there is not a single centralised crypto exchange registered in Portugal. Many of us use Binance, Bybit, Kraken, or whatever else to get our crypto gains. All these exchanges are foreign and don't have a Portuguese NIF.

See the screenshots below to see the fields in G form and the definition of entidade gestora.

[Annex G](https://preview.redd.it/4xym8lff2rpc1.png?width=1578&format=png&auto=webp&s=f8eaa3e22f98358ae4c1134aa66ee1d302b08f50)

[ In the \\""Management Entity\\"" column, enter the TIN \(tax identification number\) and country of the natural or legal person, organisation and entities without legal personality that provide custody and administration services for cryptoassets on behalf of third parties or manage one or more cryptoasset trading platforms. ](https://preview.redd.it/s7yebdjg2rpc1.png?width=1298&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e4d67a5a42fd9440734f6ee8bf881da194f5449)

The same goes for annex G1 which supposedly should help us declare our non-taxable crypto gains - it still requires a Portuguese NIF for the exchange.

[Annex G1](https://preview.redd.it/gxlhjpvi2rpc1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=45a5d11657fb99f0867d8f241d1bb128ea03223a)

One of the consultants I talked to pointed out that unless you are working with a Portuguese broker or exchange you have to declare your crypto gains in the J annex and pay 28% on them. I was confused because nobody ever mentioned the J annex anywhere in the Portuguese crypto tax guides. Turns out there is a field for crypto there.

It does look more appropriate as it doesn't mention an Entidade Gestora or a Portuguese NIF, you just need to fill in the source country.

[Annex J](https://preview.redd.it/ozi2yg3l2rpc1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=a54065506fba2c78f9f7a33ac8d5aceae02cd05e)

However, the table title reads that you need to put there crypto gains from the sale of cryptocurrencies held for periods below 365 days. So, what about crypto held for 365 days or more?

According to the consultant, they would go in the table 9.1 B for foreign profits with mandatory aggregation, which means the general tax regime with tax brackets of up to 48% depending on your income level.

[Table 9.1 B](https://preview.redd.it/qq1oamyp2rpc1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf99e322e21149789aaac856462527c665f93248)

I don't understand why because I don't see how gains from cryptocurrencies fit into any definition of the profits indicated in this table. But could he be right?

[Table 9.1 B - Definitions](https://preview.redd.it/fc735cur2rpc1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=181b7fc193fdcbd37232290f80b54d34ee6493c8)

I don't see how this could be right but then I also didn't know that crypto gains made abroad can or must be reported in Annex J.

So, my questions:

1. Do you think this is right?
2. If not, then how should we report crypto gains made from the sale of cryptocurrencies on foreign exchanges, such as Binance, and held for a period of 365 days or more? Binance doesn't have a Portuguese NIF that could be put in the G or G1 annex.
3. If the first point is correct, then why the hell nobody mentions this? How can the Portuguese tax regime be considered crypto friendly if you need a local broker to sell crypto? Why did nobody mention this in 2023 when they only introduced crypto taxes? Who even uses local brokers to sell cryptocurrencies? Everyone is on centralised exchanges. (Sorry, I needed to vent)
4. Did any of you rich Bitcoin holders consult with anyone reliable regarding crypto taxes in Portugal and did you find out anything that could help?

Did you use to be anti bitcoin ?,"Just curious, as most people I know IRL, and me myself the same,  used to be somewhere between ""don't want to know/don't want to care"" and  ""Yup, it's a bubble, definitely a bubble"".   

As a matter of fact, I still think it's entirely possible we'll  never see mass adoption and bitcoin will eventually fall into  irrelevance, having been a speculation-fuelled bubble after all. But  each passing year make it more and more likely than bitcoin's here to  stay.

*https://decrypt.co/222835/bitcoin-halving-expected-420-why-date-keeps-shifting*

Here they write that the rate at which blocks are mined depends on the demand of Bitcoin transactions, saying that more transaction cause higher rates of newly generated blocks, and conversely if nobody wants to send bitcoins, block generation speed drops.

This is of course utter nonsense! This website does not understand how difficulty adjustment and block generation works and completely confuses the uneducated reader. A horrible website that everybody should avoid!

Obviously, this website confuses causation and correlation in a way that causes severe physical pain!

Nonsense quote from that article:     
*Each block can hold approximately 2,700 transactions, but when there’s a ton of demand, the block turnarounds accelerate. When there are fewer transactions, well, then things may slow down a bit.“*

What's Autofiatgy? 🤔,"Today marks a very special day for me — and, by the time you reach the bottom of this amazing post, for you too.

Today, I introduce a brand new concept and term: ""autofiatgy."" Yes, you've never encountered this term before, and now you're probably wondering where's this bro going with this. Let me explain: ""autofiatgy,"" pronounced ""auto-fiat-gy,"" is akin to autophagy but applies to your wallet. It represents the concept—or dare I say, ""movement""—of shedding that flabby fiat in favour of bulking up with Bitcoin whilst simultaneously physically fasting. Mindblown? Read on...

As Bitcoiners, we're somewhat familiar with the fundamentals of self-sovereignty and the extensive benefits it brings: financial independence, a future-oriented outlook, and positive life choices. Yadda yadda. But what about creating a self-incentive mechanism that rewards low time preference choices by stacking Bitcoin? It's energy money, manifested in one's physical form—the ultimate decentralisation. Hash rate without the hash browns. Lolz. I want to use the term ""somatic,"" but I suspect many of you might find that a bit esoteric and checkout at this point...

Anyway, that's what I'm going to start doing...from Monday (ofc). Starting Monday, each day I complete a 24-hour fast, I will DCA (Dollar Cost Average) with $21 of BTC. This way, I'll burn off my worthless fiat along with my body fat, beefing up not just my Bitcoin stack but also my physique. See the connection? But why stop there? Why not practise DCA (Donut Cost Averaging) and replace the SAT-urated fat from the donuts I didn't eat with sats?

Here's where I should insert a call to action and envision myself as some kind of crypto Spartacus. I need to utter something compelling and rallying, reminding everyone that we have the power to dismantle not only the entire fiat currency system but also the processed food complex, making the world a better place one non-mouthful at a time. But let's face it: you love junk food, you're ingrained with too many bad habits, and yes, you've got a mortgage to pay.

In case you're wondering, a ""dirty protest"" is the act of buying shitcoins with your Bitcoin. But that's a story for another time…

Bye :)

Everyone has forgotten why bitcoin matters.,"Bitcoin was created in response to the 2008 financial crisis as a way to opt out of a failing banking and fiat system, but people seem to forget about this fact all too easily.

Everywhere on social media all I see is people talking about when to buy and when to sell in order to make more fiat. The true bitcoin OGs out there never thought this way, they wanted bitcoin as a way to protect their wealth from a failing financial system.

In 2008 the thing that caused the financial crisis was interest rates being raised from 1% to 5%. It is the raising of interest rates that always causes something to break and this time around we have raised rates from 0% to 5.5%.

Something is going to break because of this, it is an inevitability. There will be a black swan financial event that will sweep around the world, we just dont know what the trigger will be or when it will start.

When this happens banks around the world will fail, bail-ins will begin where a percentage of your bank account balance will be taken from you in order to try and save your failing bank, and central banks will flood more money into the system than ever before causing inflation to skyrocket. The only asset that will protect you from inflation, protect you from bail-ins, and allow you to transact outside of a failing banking system is bitcoin.

The entire world is going to run to bitcoin at the same time when this happens including governments who will confiscate any and all bitcoin held with a custodian as part of a bail-in policy to ""protect"" the fiat system and the banks.

Interest rates have been raised, the fiat system is cracking at the seams, its just a matter of time before a black swan event causes a financial crisis worse than 2008 to sweep around the world, and the one safe place everyone on earth will run to will be bitcoin.

This is why bitcoin exists.

It’s great for quick spurts of information but the community can go from helpful to toxic pretty quickly.

But you have one downturned week, like this one, and everyone is bashing each other and calling optimistic posts ‘corny’ and ‘ridiculous’ and shoving people away, and God forbid you try to give the newcomers any kind of hope.

I’m the only person involved in BTC, amongst my family and friends, which can feel quite isolated, and I thought this would be a place to hang out with likeminded people, but perhaps the search continues.

I've read quite a few articles recently about Trump openly supporting crypto now. Saying he wouldn't look to regulate. Sure there can be some political posturing here, but there are many politicians openly against crypto.

That said, I think we will see crypto being a large part of the political landscape going forward. Will those heavily invested, holders or just straight up believers start voting for candidates, local and nationally, who support crypto? I mean it's not crazy to think. Most people vote for what they are passionate about and what they believe in. Crypto falls into that category for many.

"""Blockchain is dumb as hell""","https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/s/6o9XtQrw7h

My reply:
would like to know why you call the blockchain stupid.

Here is why I think it isn't stupid: Everything is hackable, this is a fact. The blockchain is designed in a way that it is only hackable by surpassing 51% of the computational power that is currently being used to secure the network.

It is the most unhackable thing in existence, since you need raw computer power in order to corrupt it. It is very much the case that your local bank is actually way less secure than bitcoin at this moment.

The issue with volatility wont matter if you view bitcoin as a long term investment. Everyone who bought bitcoin and held on to it for 4 years has been in the green. Doesnt matter what time they bought.

The usefulness lies in the fact that its the most secure savings vehicle in existence and that it is able to transfer billions of funds across the planet in a matter of minutes. Yes, you would be a speculator by using it as a savings vehicle but this applies to even your everyday used currency aswel (just to a lesser extend due to low volatility)",Bitcoin,https://reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1bkn54b/blockchain_is_dumb_as_hell/,2024-03-21 21:12:38,-0.005110722610722609,0.5085547785547785,0.069,0.06,0.0

Should Bitcoin have more decimals onchain in the future?  So the blocksubsidy can keep halving sub-satoshi level? ,"

Should we get consensus to add more decimals on chain (sub-satoshi level) so we can keep continuing halving the blocksubsidy onchain? 

Otherwise miners will only get tx-fee's as reward for mining . 

If the price is after the last halving high enough,  maybe we could continue halving the blocksubsidy for much longer time without creating relatively more inflation. Just more sub Satoshi decimals. 

Today, lightning network doesn't have great incentives to manage many channels for some routing fee's.

consider that maybe it could be that we could add more data with relatively low fee in the blockspace in the future.   when we maybe have more segwit type stuff, schnorr signatures, other taproot like stuff, zk-rolllups, sidechains..  More stuff That makes blockspace cheaper 🤔

I think a lot about these things. But in more than 100 years we probably need new quantum proof eleptic Curve Cryptography that makes blockspace maybe more expensive 😬🙈

Fed's Decision Yesterday to Tolerate Higher Inflation: Great for Bitcoin," The recent Federal Reserve announcement, described by Mohamed El-Erian in [this interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeY9l7q-kx8) marks a pretty pivotal moment. The Fed displayed a surprisingly dovish stance, indicating a willingness to accept higher inflation rates for an extended period. This approach, coupled with comments on slowing the reduction of the balance sheet, suggests a shift from strict inflation targeting to a broader, more flexible strategy that allows higher inflation. I don't think they have a choice if they want to get out of the trillion dollar debt problem alive. They are going to devalue the US dollar.

The dovish signals from the Fed are not isolated. Other central banks, including the Bank of Japan and the Swiss National Bank, have also shown a propensity towards maintaining loose monetary policies.

Lessons learned ,"Just wanted to share with the new ATH buyers who are getting nervous ..

Buckle UP - It will be a wild ride. B4 the last ATH, I bought at 56k + 2 S19s miners , I diamond hands as long as I could but sold at 19k. Lost 100K.  Turned off Saylor and finally read The Bitcoin Standard for myself. Bought back at 32. DON’T be me. It was total HELL - and honestly you won’t understand until you go through it. but I learned the hard way. Now IDGAF, I honestly check bitcoin prices maybe once a day.

You will see this Sub go from euphoric to silly to angry to desperate to hopium to MAX pain then it will go silent… that’s when you know the bottom is in.

Fiat Money Is An Invasive Species?,"NOTE: This is a ChatGPT output. Posting here to see if the general concept resonates with people before I dig further into the idea. Paired with an explanation of the Cantillon Effect, this could be a great way to communicate the problem with fiat to no-coiners. :shrug: 

""Fiat money, like an invasive species, disrupts established systems by detaching from intrinsic value, akin to how invasive organisms unbalance ecosystems by lacking natural predators. Traditionally, money was a direct claim on physical assets (e.g., gold, silver), embedding a natural check on its abundance and value, much like native species evolved with checks and balances within their ecosystems. Fiat money, introduced as a human invention without direct backing, proliferates without these natural constraints, disrupting the monetary ecosystem.

This proliferation mirrors the unchecked spread of invasive species that exploit resources without contributing positively to the local environment. Just as invasive species outcompete natives for resources, leading to diminished biodiversity, fiat money can dominate an economy, leading to issues like inflation and wealth disparity, which undermine economic diversity and health. Moreover, the ""introduced"" nature of fiat money—decoupled from tangible assets—parallels how non-native species are introduced into new environments, often with unforeseen and sometimes detrimental impacts.

Both fiat money and invasive species illustrate the consequences of altering natural systems without fully understanding the long-term effects. In ecosystems, this can result in the loss of native species and altered landscapes; in economies, it can lead to financial volatility and loss of trust in currency. Thus, fiat money can be seen as an invasive creation within the natural order of monetary technologies tied to human societies, highlighting the importance of understanding and cautiously managing human interventions in complex systems.""",Bitcoin,https://reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1bkcedh/fiat_money_is_an_invasive_species/,2024-03-21 13:39:21,0.09152892561983474,0.34285714285714286,0.052,0.132,0.9762

#Bitcoin is a shining beacon of TRUTH in 🤡🌎.,"I'm fed up with living in a world where deception and dishonesty seem to prevail. Everywhere I turn, I'm bombarded with lies and half-truths. Politicians spin false narratives, corporations hide behind PR facades, and the media peddles sensationalized clickbait. It's exhausting trying to separate fact from fiction.

But amidst this chaos, there's one beacon of hope that shines brightly: #Bitcoin . It's the only truth I see in this clown world. Bitcoin's decentralized nature and transparent blockchain technology offer a refreshing respite from the constant manipulation and corruption. It's a system that operates on trustless consensus, without the need for intermediaries or middlemen. For once, I feel like I have control over my own money and my own destiny.

I know some might call me a ""maximalist"" or a ""fanatic"" for my unwavering belief in Bitcoin. But I'm willing to ""die on this hill"" because I know that Bitcoin represents something much bigger than just a digital currency. It symbolizes freedom, sovereignty, and the possibility of a better future.

With Bitcoin, I can store value without relying on inflation-prone fiat currencies or manipulated financial markets. I can transfer wealth without being beholden to predatory banks or payment processors. And I can participate in a global economy without being subject to arbitrary borders or restrictions.

Of course, Bitcoin isn't perfect. Its price can be volatile while its going through early store of value phase, its adoption can be slow, and its community can be contentious. But its underlying principles – decentralization, transparency, and security – remain unwavering.

In a world where lies and deceit seem to dominate, Bitcoin is a shining beacon of truth. And I'll continue to hold on to that truth, no matter what.

Move from Trezor One to Jade ?,"Hello hodlers :)

I stacked some sats for more than a year on my Trezor One, then I bought a Blockstream Jade.

Now I want to secure the sats. The smallest KYC UTXO is around 5 mil sats, so I don't think I really need to consolidate them. The Jade is untouched yet.

So now I have 2 options (IMO): 

\- create a new wallet on Jade and consolidate/move the UTXOs from Trezor One

\- load the existing wallet on Jade so I can have 2 hardware wallets in 2 different places (geographically)

I only use Trezor (lets say monthly) to receive sats that I bought on the exchanges and that's it, so I don't think the risk of being robbed is high. I'm more concerned about losing the seed phrase or broke the hardware wallet.

I'm more inclined to clone the existing wallet on Jade. What do you think ?",Bitcoin,https://reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1bk2ehi/move_from_trezor_one_to_jade/,2024-03-21 05:20:19,0.28963636363636364,0.5894545454545456,0.038,0.073,0.5123

How I successfully Orange-Pill,"I have had great success in orange-pilling my relatives and best friends, even though they were haters or skeptics. It’s always because of the same thing.

Do not try to sell it to them. 

First master it, you know you have done it when you are able to explain everything in simple terms, like if you were teaching a kid. 

Then, and ONLY THEN, tell them about it. Your confidence will make them trust you on the topic and showing you are not just another guy trying to fool them, you just want to share a passion. 

Then, encourage them to LEARN about Bitcoin, not to BUY Bitcoin. And ONLY ONCE THEY STUDY IT, and COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND IT, allow them to invest. Consistently tell them that if you do not understand it, do not put money into it.

Give them the resources that you think are good teachings. Make it easy for them to learn about it. I normally recommend the obvious things like the Bitcoin Standard, and Micheal Saylor Interviews and podcasts.

These are some of them:

"Grayscale still hold $25.32 Billion worth of Bitcoin. At an average outflow day, it will take them exactly 3 months until their Bitcoin holdings are depleted.","Since I figured the price of Bitcoin would be a lot higher were it not for Grayscale dumping massive amounts of Bitcoin into the market every day (although these price corrections we're seeing are a healthy sign for Bitcoin), I thought I'd do this very basic math. Please bear in mind these are just figures for the ETFs:

GBTC currently holds **378.17K BTC** worth **$25.32B**

* Assuming a steady **outflow** rate, at an average of **$270.5M** per day since January 11th ($25.32B/$270.5M), it will take them ***3 months*** (approx. 93.6 days) until their holdings are depleted;
* Assuming a steady **inflow** rate, at an average of **$261M** per day ($25.32B/$261M), it would take ETFs **97.01 days** to absorb what Grayscale is dumping.

With the Halving approximately 1 month away, supply shortage can become an issue very quickly.

What're your thoughts on this ?

What if my CoinJoin wallet was HACKED?!," 

I have some CoinJoin BTC (I coinjoined them via Trezor suite), and I can see them in my Trezor Suite app - after I manually added the CoinJoin acct like this:

If I was to rebuild that wallet in in another wallet (not Trezor), with my private keys (this is just a thought experiment) how would I see my CoinJoin balance?

I am tempted to try it, but never want to enter my key words while connected to the internet.  

I am trying to simulate if my keys were hacked. Could my CoinJoin funds be accessed without my Trezor Hardware? 

I asked Trezor support and they said YES. But then I asked EXODUS Wallet support and they said no - they don't support coinjoin.

Why run a full node?,"I recently get an ELI5 explanation of why one should run a full node and want to share here:
1. Much harder if not impossible for other people to see how much bitcoin you have. If you use a wallet such as Bluewallet to look at your holdings using a public address, via someone else’s node, the node might know which addresses you are checking, hence how many Bitcoins in there. If you run a node, you query your own node with all the addresses there, no one knows which specific addresses you are looking at.
2. You can decide which rules you want to follow and have a vote on Bitcoin’s future: Big organisations want to increase block size? Change Bitcoin code to add something you are against? You can opt out of running that version and stay on whichever version of the rules you believe is the path you want for Bitcoin.

"Hal Finney told his story with Bitcoin, 11 years ago today.","""I thought I'd write about the last four years, an eventful time for Bitcoin and me.  


For those who don't know me, I'm Hal Finney. I got my start in crypto working on an early version of PGP, working closely with Phil Zimmermann. When Phil decided to start PGP Corporation, I was one of the first hires. I would work on PGP until my retirement. At the same time, I got involved with the Cypherpunks. I ran the first cryptographically based anonymous remailer, among other activities.  


Fast forward to late 2008 and the announcement of Bitcoin. I've noticed that cryptographic graybeards (I was in my mid 50's) tend to get cynical. I was more idealistic; I have always loved crypto, the mystery and the paradox of it.  


When Satoshi announced Bitcoin on the cryptography mailing list, he got a skeptical reception at best. Cryptographers have seen too many grand schemes by clueless noobs. They tend to have a knee jerk reaction.  


I was more positive. I had long been interested in cryptographic payment schemes. Plus I was lucky enough to meet and extensively correspond with both Wei Dai and Nick Szabo, generally acknowledged to have created ideas that would be realized with Bitcoin. I had made an attempt to create my own proof of work based currency, called RPOW. So I found Bitcoin fascinating.  


When Satoshi announced the first release of the software, I grabbed it right away. I think I was the first person besides Satoshi to run bitcoin. I mined block 70-something, and I was the recipient of the first bitcoin transaction, when Satoshi sent ten coins to me as a test. I carried on an email conversation with Satoshi over the next few days, mostly me reporting bugs and him fixing them.  


Today, Satoshi's true identity has become a mystery. But at the time, I thought I was dealing with a young man of Japanese ancestry who was very smart and sincere. I've had the good fortune to know many brilliant people over the course of my life, so I recognize the signs.  


After a few days, bitcoin was running pretty stably, so I left it running. Those were the days when difficulty was 1, and you could find blocks with a CPU, not even a GPU. I mined several blocks over the next days. But I turned it off because it made my computer run hot, and the fan noise bothered me. In retrospect, I wish I had kept it up longer, but on the other hand I was extraordinarily lucky to be there at the beginning. It's one of those glass half full half empty things.  


The next I heard of Bitcoin was late 2010, when I was surprised to find that it was not only still going, bitcoins actually had monetary value. I dusted off my old wallet, and was relieved to discover that my bitcoins were still there. As the price climbed up to real money, I transferred the coins into an offline wallet, where hopefully they'll be worth something to my heirs.  


Speaking of heirs, I got a surprise in 2009, when I was suddenly diagnosed with a fatal disease. I was in the best shape of my life at the start of that year, I'd lost a lot of weight and taken up distance running. I'd run several half marathons, and I was starting to train for a full marathon. I worked my way up to 20+ mile runs, and I thought I was all set. That's when everything went wrong.  


My body began to fail. I slurred my speech, lost strength in my hands, and my legs were slow to recover. In August, 2009, I was given the diagnosis of ALS, also called Lou Gehrig's disease, after the famous baseball player who got it.  


ALS is a disease that kills moter neurons, which carry signals from the brain to the muscles. It causes first weakness, then gradually increasing paralysis. It is usually fatal in 2 to 5 years. My symptoms were mild at first and I continued to work, but fatigue and voice problems forced me to retire in early 2011. Since then the disease has continued its inexorable progression.  


Today, I am essentially paralyzed. I am fed through a tube, and my breathing is assisted through another tube. I operate the computer using a commercial eyetracker system. It also has a speech synthesizer, so this is my voice now. I spend all day in my power wheelchair. I worked up an interface using an arduino so that I can adjust my wheelchair's position using my eyes.  


It has been an adjustment, but my life is not too bad. I can still read, listen to music, and watch TV and movies. I recently discovered that I can even write code. It's very slow, probably 50 times slower than I was before. But I still love programming and it gives me goals. Currently I'm working on something Mike Hearn suggested, using the security features of modern processors, designed to support ""Trusted Computing"", to harden Bitcoin wallets. It's almost ready to release. I just have to do the documentation.  


And of course the price gyrations of bitcoins are entertaining to me. I have skin in the game. But I came by my bitcoins through luck, with little credit to me. I lived through the crash of 2011. So I've seen it before. Easy come, easy go.  


That's my story. I'm pretty lucky overall. Even with the ALS, my life is very satisfying. But my life expectancy is limited.

Rise of the Bitcoin Nanny,"I miss the good old conversations

Some years back you could hop into this subreddit, learn about finance, debate about how ecomomies work, beef about which wallet gives more privacy, and pick out the nitty gritty of blockchains.

Blocksize wars to defend the founding principles of Bitcoin were sight to behold. People disagreed, but you could still appreciate the arguments. The winning chain went ahead uninterrupted.

Sending sats to Bitcoin developer wallets to keep them going..The eagerness with watching Segwit activate....Countdown to Taproot upgrade while pushing miners to get on board...Those were good times.

Some dude used to give updates on day-to-day living on Bitcoin as inflation tore through his country. I wonder where he went.

Then the laser eyes and cultic hodl crowd took over

Moderators delete any talk of development on Bitcoin that doesn't align with 'just stack sats and hodl'

It's as if it goes against Bitcoin ethos to think freely. The only thing that matters is green candles to pump your DCA bags.

I barely see any devs talking here. 

Even traders can't sneak in any market analysis without being downvoted to oblivion

Want to sell and book profits? How DARE you??!!

Rode on Tesla buying Bitcoin but went into full on rage against Musk when the company chose to sell.

Basically worship Saylor at this point.

They're not Bitcoin maxis any more.
More like Bitcoin nannies.

Don't think.

Grayscale now uncompetitive and the price dip is just a restructuring of the ETF market,"Looking at the flows from the ETF's it seems to me that Grayscale has really taken a tanking since the opening of the other spot ETF's. The price decrease seems to have resulted in large scale flows from Grayscale but all the other information suggests large inflows of cash still flowing into the BlackRock and fidelity ETF's. 

&#x200B;

The price volatility is definilty more than I would have expected with the large amount of coins taken by the ETF's and placed in cold wallets. However I wonder if most of the sales from the grayscale ETF are making their way to the other spot ETF's. As they are mandated to but the underlying asset in order to match the inflows of the funds I can not see a scenario where this does not result in a price increase following the halving. ou would think this downside volatility will reduce over time with the increased commercial holdings

THE FUTURE OF BITCOIN MINING...,"* Large scale miners are beginning to show dominance in the industry and continuing to add capacity rapidly
* Smaller miners are starting to consolidate to achieve economies of scale
* Network hash is higher than where most expected and continuing to grow aggressively
* Hashrate will become more globally distributed at scale.  Already seeing sovereign adoption kicking off (UAE/Burma).  Significant growth expected from Latam, Middle East, South East Asia, Africa.  
* The race to zero energy cost mining has begun: a) Bitcoin miners are currently helping to stabilise grids and cost engineering their net energy cost down as a result; b) Bitcoin miners finding other creative ways to net off energy costs (e.g. monetising waste heat).  This trend will only continue.
* Bitcoin mining will compete, head-on, with battery technology (when it finally catches up) as the 2 main tools available to energy grids for stabilisation.
* The logical candidates for Bitcoin mining in the long run are energy companies with excess energy they are unable to store or transport it (i.e. zero marginal cost of energy)

Bitcoin is treated like a risk asset,"The perception of Bitcoin as a risk asset rather than a hedge stems from its historical behavior in correlation with traditional markets, particularly equities. Bitcoin’s price movements have often mirrored those of risk assets like stocks, leading many to view it as a speculative investment rather than a safe haven.

However, proponents argue that Bitcoin’s scarcity and decentralized nature make it a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty, akin to gold. They suggest that its limited supply and lack of correlation with traditional assets could provide diversification benefits in a portfolio.

The recent reaction to the Federal Reserve’s indication of potential rate cuts illustrates Bitcoin’s current alignment with risk assets. When the Fed hints at accommodative monetary policy, both equities and Bitcoin tend to rally, suggesting a correlation between the two.

Yet, it’s crucial to recognize that this correlation doesn’t guarantee Bitcoin’s performance in all market conditions. In the event of a significant downturn or “black swan” event in traditional markets, Bitcoin could indeed experience a sell-off as investors seek liquidity and safety in more established assets.

Ultimately, while some investors may view Bitcoin as a hedge, its behavior in various market environments underscores the importance of thorough risk management and understanding its role within a diversified investment strategy.",Bitcoin,https://reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1bjnszi/bitcoin_is_treated_like_a_risk_asset/,2024-03-20 16:41:35,0.11130952380952379,0.5491402116402117,0.093,0.14,0.8442
Break it and get 159k sats,"Hello,
My 12 words were generated by an air-gapped Bluewallet. Then I encrypted them with a passcode, and then created a QRCode that I engraved on a steel plate (using my own laser engraver).
It is extremely elegant and resistant.
Neat.

I keep this metal plate in a safe place. It is just in case of my death or absence. I know my words by heart and every time I need to sell (which I don’t because I hold), I create a wallet on an air-gapped Bluewallet to sign the transaction. On my mobile, I have a wallet with the xpub just to receive and transmit the signed transaction. 

I’d like to test how good the encryption and the approach is if the metal wallet ends up in adversarial hands.

So I am proposing a challenge. I created a new wallet and topped up with around $100 (159k SATs).
This is the xpub for you to view and verify:

Pricing bitcoin in USD? (Fiat),"I've noticed that in this subreddit, a lot of people keep an eye on the price you can get for selling bitcoin (including myself quite often).

What I find interesting is, at least for me, that the amount of bitcoin I own primarily matters in the amount of bitcoin I have, and pricing it in an inflationary asset is misguided to say the least.

The cognitive dissonance I feel I have is the belief and knowledge  that the amount of btc I own isn't going to depend on fiat, at least in the long run. However i do find myself consistently looking at the price of bitcoin rather than the Sats I own. I have a strong belief that in 25+ years, I will be considerably wealthy in terms of bitcoin, but for some reason here and in my own life I can't get away from checking how much my btc is worth from a fiat standard...

That being said, I know we are long ways away from diverting from a fiat standard, and therefor going to still price things in fiat for the considerable future, I just think people would benefit from (including myself) focusing on the sats they have rather than the amount they can get from selling. 

I guess that's why they say 1 btc = 1 btc

I bought Bitcoin in my sleep.," I have a history of sleep walking during periods of stress. My most memorable fiasco is of being startled awake by the sound of my brand new smart TV crashing to the ground after I ran into it. It splatted screen first onto the hard tile floor of the basement I was living in at that time. Lately, I’ve been spending money online in my sleep. One night I bought a Sam’s club membership. A couple days later I ordered a Resident Evil DVD from eBay. Yesterday, I awoke to find a receipt from PayPal in my inbox for $20 worth of Bitcoin. I thought it was some scam or phishing thing at first. I checked my PayPal account and found that I do, indeed, have $20.24 of Bitcoin. I acquired a little money from an unlawful death suit for my grandma recently.

Genuine discussion: What are your arguments against these common criticisms of Bitcoin?,"Hey everyone, in the midst of this bull run we're seeing a lot of meme posts, tweets, and people recklessly shilling Bitcoin. I would like to take the opportunity to ask this community some more genuine questions about their view on some of the common criticisms against Bitcoin.

* Bitcoin consumes a huge amount of energy

As Bitcoin continues to be more adopted, so does the amount of energy it consumes. Bitcoin transactions are complex and it is said that 1 Bitcoin transaction consumes more electricity than a US household does in a month. The Bitcoin network consumes more electricity than some countries, and if it was to be globally adopted it could consume more electricity than is currently produced in the world. Since this emits a lot of carbon, some people argue Bitcoin is environmentally damaging.

* Bitcoin runs on the greater fool theory and therefore is a ponzi scheme

Anytime money is invested into Bitcoin, it goes into the pockets of the previous holders. If you buy Bitcoin, you'll always make a profit (relative to buying power), but only on the condition that there is someone next in line ready to buy after you at a higher price. And since the amount of people willing to buy Bitcoin is limited, in order to make  
a gain you are relying on greater fools to buy at a higher price and take a loss when you exchange your Bitcoins for something else. This is why Bitcoin is often criticised as a ponzi scheme, the early investors win and those late to the party will get burned.

* Bitcoin has no value

Many people argue that Bitcoin is extremely valuable for 3 main reasons:

1. It has a limited supply and therefore the price will appreciate.
1. Bitcoin is decentralised and so there is no entity able to corrupt it.
1. Lower international transaction fees

However, many people argue that these advantages only serve as speculation which gets Bitcoin more adopted and allows more people to fall for the ""scam"". It could be criticised that it is a macro version of speculative altcoins. Many Bitcoin maximalists call altcoins a scam as their value is speculative and the price only drives up when people who believe the speculation buy in, some would argue that Bitcoin is doing the same.

So, I am curious what the Bitcoin community thinks about these criticisms and what counter arguments you can make for them. Please note that the purpose of this thread is to serve as an informative discussion rather than cause controversy.",Bitcoin,https://reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1birczi/genuine_discussion_what_are_your_arguments/,2024-03-19 14:27:15,0.18455357142857146,0.4946428571428571,0.119,0.12,0.1298

Does a passphrase add entropy to a 24-word seed to make it more difficult to random brute force attack?,"Does adding a 6-word passphrase to a 24-word seed make a wallet significantly more difficult to brute force attack?  The 24-word seed already has 256 bits of entropy (the maximum available) so the passphrase won't add additional entropy, right?  

If this is the case, the passphrase is only really effective for physical security (i.e. someone finds your seed phrase but can't access your wallet unless they then find/brute force your passphrase.)

Will Bitcoin fail at some point because of it's hardcoded scarcity?,"Genuine Question. Scarcity is something that gives btc its value but we already have a huge chunk of btc that are inaccessible for various reasons and I believe in the future we will lose access to even more because we forget or lose our passphrase or die unexpectedly and never set up a will with the necessary infos to access the btc.

Lets say hypothetically, at some point in the Future only around 1BTC remains accessible. 1 Satoshi could become incredibly expensive or worthless depending on the demand.

3. There are people who can't sleep at night because they bought Bitcoin at a dollar and sold at 100 dollars so that they could remodel their kitchen or something.


4. Allocation isn't a binary. When you sell, you don't have to go all-out. When you buy, you don't have to go all-in.


5. If you sell, what would you buy that you expect to outperform Bitcoin or that makes you happier than owning Bitcoin?


6. What convinced you to buy in the first place and has that situation changed?


7. What does life changing even mean? If you are rich, will you be happy or will you simply be an unhappy rich person? Does selling Bitcoin really ""fix it"" or might it just break something else later on?

Why doesn't he just use his own trading indicators that he is selling to earn money?

This man is dangerous because he tries to convince people that his PhD in Physics means he can predict the price movement of Bitcoin.

The only thing he did was plot the log-log of the price of bitcoin relative to time. Anyone that is decent in math can do this.

Reminder for new members: bitcoin is for saving. ,"Hi newbie!

When lambo? No. Nope.

Bitcoin is already the best savings tech you have ever used and by using it and learning about it as you use it your world view will probably shift for the better. Long time preference and seeing hard work in savings grow not shrink. 

How do you use bitcoin ""correctly""?

Save in it. Put away money into bitcoin* each money with the understanding you can't touch it for at least 4 years. In year 5 you can spend what you saved in year 1 if you need it. If you spend some (converting back to local fiat, paying tax, buying stuff you need) then that's ok. That's the point of the savings technology. You save it and when you need it; it's there to use. The bonus part is the longer you delay spending the more you can buy. 

TLDR: bitcoin is not a lambo millionaire tech, but it does even better. It allows you to save money from a real world job and have a chance at a house deposit or retirement one day.

*how you do the into bitcoin part is up to you, cold storage, ETF, exchange account, etc it's all personal preferences and there is plenty of information on those topics in the sub.

0.1 bitcoin,"at time of writing will run you 9k cad buckaroos or 6.5k usd (god our dollars fucking shit eh)


9k for 10,000,000 satoshi is, while expensive, still an incredible bargain, to stake your claim and get a piece of this 21m monetary network. 

If you are reading this right now and are able to *comfortably* stack 0.1 BTC (without bankruptcy) in your portfolio and you haven't yet, I highly suggest you a) do more research on Bitcoin and b) buy enough bitcoin to reach at least 0.1 BTC while we're going thru this mini dip. Otherwise you will come to regret it. 

One of these days we are going to see BTC break 135k cad (100k usd), at which point newcomers will be aiming for under 10m satoshis, and the new benchmark will move from 1.0 BTC to 0.1 BTC.

9k in savings alone is already out of reach for a lot of families and working class professionals where I live, but possible with stable income and savings etc. Obv be responsible dont yolo your emergency fund and have other investments, diversify etc

Most people in my life own exactly 0 BTC and think its a scam/too expensive etc.

i only have a .25 coin which is ok (still stacking) since starting my btc journey in dec2020

but i am interested in the stock market and want to get into it. i see it as a good way to appreciate wealth but ofc im conflicted. nothing will appreciate like BTC so i know id be missing out on gains purposely comparative to BTC (long term)

but i also see it as a layer of wealth i can tap into before tapping into BTC fund which i see as a plus

i have pretty decent salary but i don't have much savings (<500) bc i throw it all in btc rather than watching it die in my bank acc. but i am well aware i should have emergency savings for just in case, i am working on this but rather slowly like 100 each pay check to savings. but then i get into a loop seeing $1000+ in savings doing nothing but depreciate. especially in the months of NOV-JAN with the halving coming closer and closer

i have determined i will have a savings but probably only $1000 but with inflation is that even enough, this def a case by case basis but idk how much would y'all recommend?

"The simple rebuttal to people saying no-one would spend a deflationary currency: If you knew everything would be 2% cheaper next year, what would you actually stop buying?","People often attack Bitcoin by saying no-one would ever spend it. Well, as it stands now, yes, you'd be stupid to spend your bitcoin. The potential for growth is just too high.

However, it is just a fact that bitcoin cannot continue this growth indefinitely. At some point it will stabilise. It will still be deflationary, but the 50% rises in a year will be a thing of a past. You'll just see small, incremental deflation on a year to year basis (as opposed to fiat which slowly bleeds you out). At that point you can ask: What would you actually stop buying if it will be 2% cheaper next year?

Sure, a currency that deflates 50% a year on average wouldn't be spent. But then, a currency that inflates on average 50% a year is useless too. If you're going to talk about deflationary currency not working, then use deflation figures in line with what you would use for discussing in inflationary currency. Really, deflation or inflation in the range of 0 to 5% isn't going to change many people's purchases. The difference is one allows you to save over the long run, one destroys you over the long run.",Bitcoin,https://reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1bhop49/the_simple_rebuttal_to_people_saying_noone_would/,2024-03-18 07:43:55,-0.07294117647058823,0.4222875816993465,0.074,0.06,0.0
How could a World with mass adoption look like?,"I've been trying to think about how a world could look like, once Bitcoin is globally accepted and a ""nornal"" paying method. 

This is not me challenging if it's possible or not, but rather really being curious how it would work out.

Would offline markets like local stores, coffee shops, etc. all have a live connection to the exchanges, in order to not sell their goods under value? Would they maybe just update their prices once per day? Would the price be shown in Bitcoin next to USD/EUR etc. next to every product, or would other currencies even still exist?
What if Bitcoin is still crazily volatile in the future? How would the small companies & entrepreneurs survive big drops in price then? Or even on employee side - imagine being only paid in Bitcoin, but then getting paid out at a time of a low-price Phase and earning less than what you are used too.

But maybe mass adoption would lead to the volatility reducing towards 0 as the market dictates the ""final"" price.
I guess as I am writing this I think my question is not ""what will the price be?"" - I couldn't care less about the exact number - my question is rather: ""is it possible for bitcoin to reach a 'final' price?"" Where it increases/decreases only about 0-2% or so.

IIRC one theory could also be that the currencies get backed by Bitcoin similar to as it has been with the gold standard, but how this would exactly look like is a bit hard to imagine for me (maybe there will be these exchanges/stores where you can sell your gold stuff or buy gold at the current rate, but just with bitcoin lol).  
I also think just looking at how the system worked with the gold standard and transfering this to a bitcoin standard doesn't work 1to1, as we almost live in a different world now compared to 19xx.

Really curious on your thoughts, if you had similar thoughts or maybe came to some conclusions because I didn't consider a particular thing etc. :) Also, if you guys/ladies have any resources that are diving into these topics, feel free to share - would be happy to expand my knowledge, as I love to invest my time into learning more about bitcoin etc. when I'm out of money to Invest :P

A Global Tax on Electricity for Bitcoin Mining Would Not Affect Profitability,"# Effects of a theoretical global mining tax

Every miner would have their electricity costs increased by 30%. Network hash rate drops by 30%. Mining difficulty drops by 30%. Bitcoin transaction time balances out and 900 bitcoins are still produced per day (450 after the next halving). The same amount of revenue is distributed amongst the mining network at 30% less hash rate. At the end of the day everyone is getting paid the same amount to do 30% less ""work"".

# Public good

From a public good perspective this would decrease the global demand for electricity by bitcoin mining by 30%. Demand for electricity increases the price of electricity as well as increases environmental impact. 30% less electricity demanded by the network means 30% less carbon emissions and lower electricity costs for consumers. An optimized network would run at the lowest possible hash rate to ensure security. The network becomes less efficient as hash rate increases.

There's also a consideration that the tax money would decrease governmental defecits. Lower deficit means less inflation, and everyone on here understands how bad inflation is.

# Network Security

Theoretically, higher hash = better security, but there are diminishing returns. As the hash rate grows, a 51% attack becomes economically unrealistic and we are well past that point currently. Additional hash rate therefore doesn't decrease the practical chances of a 51% attack because it's already not a risk. Likewise, there is leeway for the hash rate to drop without impacting network security. Hash rate is a function of bitcoin price, mining costs, and the current block rewards + transaction fees. As such, each halving impacts the hash rate in a similar way that a global tax would.

TL;DR:

A theoretical global tax on electricity for bitcoin miners would have minimal impact on the bitcoin network, no impact on mining revenue, would decrease carbon emissions, decrease consumer cost of electricity, and could help decrease governmental budget deficits.",Bitcoin,https://reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1bitqe0/a_global_tax_on_electricity_for_bitcoin_mining/,2024-03-19 16:02:24,-0.013333333333333324,0.28,0.094,0.104,0.3804

My current understanding of the pros and cons of whether to invest in it are as follows:

- supply shortage 
- positive sentiment surrounding the halving 
- El Salvador 
- continuous printing of fiat currencies means that BTC can theoretically go to infinity 

Cons: 
- volatile
- fundamentally has no real use 
- unsustainable blockchain validation process

Overall, my opinion is that I will only ever invest if it becomes clear the us economy has avoided a recession.

Bitcoin is better than Gold in almost every way possible.,"Bitcoin has absolute scarcity with 21 million hard cap, while Gold's stock to flow inflation is about 1.5-2% a year on average. 
After April halving this year, Bitcoin's stock to flow inflation will officially dip below that of Gold, and will become *hardest asset ever* by definition. 

Bitcoin is faster than Gold and extremely portable, you can send a billion dollars from New York to Tokyo and have it final settlement in 30minutes. 

Bitcoin is easily verifiable on the blockchain if the fund is there or not. Gold often has to be melted down or cut to verify theres no tungsten inside then the seller's charged a re-smelting fee etc. 

Bitcoin can be divided down to a hundred millionth of a bitcoin and transmitted at such infinitesimal amounts (network fees can, however, make transmission of tiny amounts uneconomic, this is where L2 and eventually L3 comes in). Gold is very difficult to do so without incurring additional cost.

Both Bitcoin *and* Gold are **fungible** and **durable**, with Gold having the longest established history as a monetary good.

However Gold is a poor store of value whose price has been largely the same over past decade against rampant inflation while Bitcoin has seen explosive, albeit extremely volatile, growth and adoption in same amount of time.

Bitcoin, despite its short existence, has weathered enough trials in the 15-year market that there is a high likelihood it will not vanish as a valued asset any time soon. Furthermore, the Lindy effect suggests that the longer Bitcoin remains in existence the greater society’s confidence that it will continue to exist long into the future. 

Aside from being a dumb shiny yellow rock, used in jewellery, art and electronics, Gold is inferior to Bitcoin in nearly every way. 

Gold is stuck in the ground, Bitcoin is stuck in time. It's time we embrace the future.

Stay humble. Stack sats.

My work won't allow BTC ETF as an investment option in our 401k. How can I change that?,"I work for a large global company who just happens to be owned by none other than Berkshire Hathaway.   We have fidelity as our 401k partner and they have the FBTC ETF option available currently.

I called Fidelity to confirm that their fbtc ETF is available to be put within the account and they confirmed it was. The reason it wasn't available to select as an option is because the company specifically declined to do so.

I contacted the investment advisor at my company and asked them why this wasn't an option. All I got in response was a one sentence reply:

""This option was discussed at a committee meeting and deemed too risky due to regulatory uncertainty""

I responded back with an email full of bullet points talking about how this was deemed to commodity by the SEC, how a Bitcoin ETF was recently approved in January, how fasb is allowing corporations to carry Bitcoin on their balance sheets and also stating the fact that fidelity already offers this as an investment option.

I even offered to me with this committee to discuss their concerns about this asset being unregulated. Still waiting for a reply back on that email but in the meantime I'd like to know if there are some talking points or a script of sorts I could use to convey the point.

I can't help but think the sole reason why this is not allowed is due to the fact that Warren and Charlie think it's rat poison squared. The fact that their personal bias impact the financial well-being of myself and every single person employed within the company I work for really pisses me off.

It’s essential that BTC price remains higher after halving to secure the network & prevent hash rate from dropping,"After halving, the block rewards will be significantly cut . Retail miners or small scale miners can’t remain profitable . Mining can become more centralised among institutional investors. Which is scary.
Only solution to this problem is , high priced BTC. So that block rewards can keep the lights on for the small scale miners. 
If the retail miners stops mining along with the rest of em, this can lead to drop in hashrate significantly that can compromise the security of BTC network. Saylors & black rocks of the world should start investing in mining capabilities to protect their investments & their clients .

I’ve recently seen people refer to someone who holds 1M sats as a ‘satillionaire’, and now I’m wondering how that term would scale.

If we used traditional Greek Numerical Prefixes, it might look something like this:

1M = Satillionaire AKA ‘A Monosat’

5M = Pantasatillionaire AKA ‘A Pentasat’

10M = Decasatillionairs AKA ‘A Decasat’

100M = Centasatillionaire AKA ‘A Centasat’

1000M = Kilosatillionaire AKA ‘A Kilosat’

Is there a more fitting set of numerical prefixes?

"Even simpler rebuttal to people claiming that no one would spend a deflationary currency: If you know everything would be 2% cheaper next year, what would you actually stop buying?","TLDR: The argument essentially boils down to: If you can currently buy Bitcoin, which is expected to increase in value, why spend your money on anything else? Obviously, people don't only buy Bitcoin, so the argument that Bitcoin cannot act as a currency because it is deflationary is flawed.

The people making these claims are assuming that Bitcoin is deflationary by nature (which makes sense) so let's assume so. They also argue that it is because we are currently working with an inflationary currency that the economy is working as it is today, with people deciding to spend their money the way they do.

If Bitcoin is a deflationary currency, and we assume that, relative to Bitcoin, everything will be on average 2% cheaper every following year, then why would anyone be spending any money now instead of exchanging their fiat for Bitcoin, which reduces to the case where people are using Bitcoin as a deflationary currency? Since people aren't deciding to spend little to none of their money, simply because they can instead buy Bitcoin which is expected to increase in value, this reduction tells us that people's purchasing behaviours would not be drastically different from what they are now, if we began to use Bitcoin.

The only major difference, as pointed out by this post:

"How does average quality of life for low, medium, and high earners change in money printing countries (namely the US) after the transition to a bitcoin standard?","In developed countries, it seems that quality of life is subsidized by money printing I'm wondering if quality of life would overall be reduced if put under a bitcoin standard? Bitcoin would help create a global standard of what work is worth. 

Currently in the US, for example, a low skill worker might make $10 per hour. The same job might be done in a low wage country for $1 per hour. Does Bitcoin adoption change the gap between these two peoples' wages? Do they both go up? Do they converge somewhere in the middle? Does it stay the same?

Under a Bitcoin standard it seems the most important things for a country will be:

* How early did your country adopt bitcoin? - How much bitcoin per person does your government have in reserves? How much bitcoin per person do your citizens own?
* How much general technology/infrastructure (manufacturing, roads, building infrastructure, etc) head start do you have?

"Kinda lost, show me the way.","Hey there. I am not into Crypto yet and yes BTC going up again made me (and many more i guess) of course to think about it.  
My Problem is that i dont know where to start. There are so many different videos/guides around Crypto and BTC and in my head is a constant chaos. Do i have to invest a lot to see profit? Can i start buying BTC with 100€ every month? Is there any reliable articles to learn about wallets and how the whole scene work? All i hear is ""never invest"", but in our days, making an income via Internet and Crypto is becoming more and more attractive.

Decentralized Government ,"
1. **Infrastructure Development**: Developing robust technical infrastructure supporting the Bitcoin blockchain and Layer-2 solutions for voting and proposals is crucial. This may involve adapting existing solutions or developing specific DApps.

2. **Ensuring Participation**: Ensuring broad citizen participation is essential for a democratic government. Mechanisms need to be developed to ensure all citizens have access to voting and proposal platforms and can actively participate.

3. **Ensuring Transparency and Security**: Security and transparency are fundamental for a democratic government. Technologies used, such as the Bitcoin blockchain, must be robust and implement strict security measures to prevent tampering.

4. **Developing Governance Models**: Governance models need to be developed to ensure decisions are made in a fair and democratic manner. This could include incorporating various voting methods, thresholds for decisions, and mechanisms for resolving disputes.

5. **Legal and Social Acceptance**: Establishing legal frameworks and gaining broad social acceptance for a democratic decentralized government based on Bitcoin and blockchain technology may require political and public support.

6. **Education and Awareness**: Since many citizens may be new to using Bitcoin and blockchain technology, education and awareness initiatives are important to promote understanding and acceptance.

7. **Continuous Improvement and Adaptation**: Implementing a democratic decentralized government is an ongoing process requiring continuous improvements and adaptations to respond to changes in technology and society.

Value of Bitcoin held on exchanges in $USD,"

Observations:

1. $USD value of bitcoin held on exchanges has increased approximately +114% over the past year.
2. Since ETFs were approved $USD value on exchanges increased +48%
3. Quantity held on exchanges decreased by 11% over the past year
4. Quantity held on exchanges decreased by \~4% since ETFs were approved (-81K bitcoin)

ETFs have acquired a net of 216K bitcoin so far. That 216K has only decreased quantity on exchanges by 81K. Possibly retail is taking profits, possibly people transfering bitcoin holdings to ETFs, possibly ETFs getting filled some other way.

$USD value of bitcoin held on exchanges peaked at $180 B during the peak in November 2021. This trend of increasing $USD value held on exchanges goes against the supply crunch narrative (for now). At current prices the halving will decrease new supply by $31 M per day, or .023 % of exchange held supply per day. 

Basically, the price is increasing faster than the quantity held on exchanges is decreasing, which has caused the $USD value of Bitcoin held on exchanges to rise.",Bitcoin,https://reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1bhpqzh/value_of_bitcoin_held_on_exchanges_in_usd/,2024-03-18 08:40:16,-0.09928977272727274,0.6455965909090909,0.0,0.135,0.9723

Questions on the Bitcoin protocol,"hey all , even though i have been involved in the crypto space for past 4 years now. never took the time to truly understand it.  doing whats long overdue now.

Some questions,

1. from my understanding all the upgrades in the main bitcoin chain right now are softforks and softforks are changes such that new rules / features are implemented but the old rules still apply. so even if a miner does not update their node they would still agree with the transactions sent by the nodes running the new version ... if so would it be safe to say if i took a node running the bitcoin 0.1 version ( the version in which the genesis block was mined ) and ran it through all the transactions today. it would still clear all of them and mark them all as valid? chatgpt says this is false, is it wrong. if it is correct then how would the new upgrades be considered a softfork then?
2. as the block rewards get thinner and thinner. and eventually coming to a point where the nodes are only mining for the transaction fee. from a economical perspective do you think the miners would still continue? yes of course if the price keeps increasing they would but what if there was a prolonged bitcoin winter. and prices for some reason plummeted .. this makes it no longer practical for the miners to support the network. and if there are no miners to support the network would it not collapse the network?

Bitcoin is perfect money because perfect money is pure information.,"First money was different commodities, then money was gold, then money was gold represented by paper, then money was paper represented by bank ledgers.

This is a phyiscal way to view money but money has only ever been information. The items we used as money were just a way to communicate information about value to eachother. 

When humans exchanged a gold coin that was the mechanism used to communicate to the rest of the world that value had been transferred from one person to another and that one person now held more and one person now held less. The gold was the informational mechanism telling everyone else who had what amount of value in society.

In a prehistoric tribe of cavemen who keep tally of one person owing another person some food by etching it into a cave wall, that ledger on the cave wall was their form of monetary information because it was their method of transacting and communicating value.

Money is pure information we just havent had the ability to represent money as pure information before bitcoin, instead we have had to use inefficient abstractions to represent monetary information. Bitcoin represents the first time humanity has had the ability to represent money as pure information making information the monetary asset itself.

Every other form of money we have ever used in history has been inefficient and inferior. Bitcoin is money in its most pure form.

UK banks suck.,"Trying to buy bitcoin through Coinbase or Kraken within the UK is ridiculously frustrating. Starling don’t allow anything crypto, santander has a yearly limit, Monzo blocked my funds for 4 days and then proceeded to tell me they think it’s a scam even after I proved everything. And just last night I tried to buy more and Revolut have put a block on £1500 whilst previously allowing £2000 and holding a decent amount of BTC inside Revolut itself.

Why is there so many hoops to jump through when spending my own money on Crypto, and they try to say they are doing it to protect me, yet I could drop £20k in a gambling site and they wouldn’t even give a shit.

Rant over.

Are there any banks that you have used within the UK that allow purchasing through Kraken that you have had no bother with?

In regards to dip buying,"What’s up to all my bitcoin fam. Shout out to all the risk takers and world changers that sees what is happening. I tip my hat to ya.

I wanted to drop a piece of advice one of my grandmas told me when buying my first home. Around 2021 my wife and I purchased our first home. It was a big deal because my dad and mom didn’t own a home and I felt like I was on my way to bringing on some possible generational wealth. I was VERY stressed during the buying process. Having a wife and three kids, I wanted to make sure I got the best deal. So I spent so much time worrying about prices. One day I was talking to my grandma, sharing with her my stress. She dropped a gem that I still think about when investing. After sharing my worries, she replied, “Sweetie, regardless of the rate or if it’s a little higher than expected just remember, no one in 20 years says ‘Damn I wish I waited to buy that house’”. And man, that stuck with me. And it’s so true. When you look at the way houses have gone up, people usually wish they purchased another home. 
So I use that logic with investing today. Taking advantage of dips is fine and can give us a hand up, but ultimately in 20 years when bitcoin is $10,000,000 per coin or whatever astronomical number it is, the dips ain’t gunna matter. It will be such a small blip of time compared to years of long term investing. So with that said, I want to remind yall to breath, relax, and enjoy this amazing ride. The stress of trying to buy in at the rate time is not needed when you plan to HODL. Zooming out and looking at something from a Birds Eye view is quite different than watching the day to day.

Sparrow Wallet,"I am currently working on transferring my Sats from my ELLIPAL titan to a newly purchased cold card. I like my titan a lot because it is very user friendly and I like being able to open the app and audit my coins regularly but after much reading and knowing where the price of BTC is heading I decided on moving over to a BTC only wallet. I created a new sparrow wallet and used the airgapped option via microsd and got some test Sats transferred successfully. So here’s my question, I understand that even with my ELLIPAL that my Sats exist on the block chain and I have the keys to move them. So when I transfer them from the titan to sparrow they’re not sitting in a fashion that makes them vulnerable to be stolen because ultimately I would have to initiate a transfer and sign it with my coldcard correct? For some reason that is not backed by any facts or reason, after I transferred the two test transactions I felt as if they were more vulnerable than if I left them in a Coinbase wallet or on an exchange.

"Is there a financial advisor ""flippening"" in the works?","I am fascinated by the financial advisory industry and Bitcoin.  The industry has been trained to sh\*t on Bitcoin for years and years (speculative, gambling, no intrinsic value, not backed by anything etc. etc.). but there appears to be a “flippening” which much more Bitcoin chatter in the mainstream financial media.

This is why Fidelity and BlackRock ETF was a game changer.  (Versus who the f\*\*k is Coinbase, FTX and Binance??)

I am beginning to believe advisors will shift from “it is irresponsible for me to put you in bitcoin” to  “it is irresponsible for me NOT to have you in bitcoin”

When will clients start asking “Why didn’t you have me in the best performing asset of the decade?” if they are not already?

Does the script change to “For our conservative investors we are going to put you in at one percent as a hedge. For aggressive investors we will put you in at 5% for our most aggressive investors we are recommending a 15% allocation.” Our research team shows this is likely to improve returns due to his lack of correlation with traditional stocks and bonds, superior Sharpe ratio yada yada yada.

If this occurs in reality it will be more rocket fuel for bitcoin!

Proof of Work algorithm: the end line of bitcoin's value is eventually the price of energy required to mine it.," Hi all,

I would like to hear the opinion of someone technically knowledgeable on the subject, because this is not my field.

I would like if someone could point out if I am making any mistake in my reasoning.

My understanding is:

1. The proof of work algorithm behind bitcoin's blockchain is designed in such a way that a block must always be released at a given frequency. Therefore, the difficulty of the decryption problem tunes itself depending on how much hashrate (and so electrical power) is being invested in mining at any given moment.
2. If bitcoin price increases due to market dynamics (demand/offer), miners are incentivized to mine depending on the differential between the cost of energy necessary to mine, and the current value of bitcoin.
3. When miners do so, the global hashrate increases up until the total price of the energy spent is equal to the current value of bitcoin.

For these reasons, wishing for a bitcoin to reach very high values is essentially equivalent to:

A) Reaching a point where massive amounts of energy will be necessary (so that the price equilibrium between energy and bitcoin value is matched).

B) Reaching a point where the unit price of electrical power is very high, even if the necessary quantity is low.

Neither of the above scenarios seem good to me, and this is the reason why I don't believe the way bitcoin is designed can sustainably keep it at such high value.

Case A) essentially means we will be wasting a lot of energy just to keep the value of bitcoin high

Case B) means we have other problems to worry about, such as energy becoming more and more scarce.

maybe i'm missing something, but i do not understand why there can't be a way to reverse unspent transactions.   

it seems to be a huge design flaw/oversight to me that everyday  people are expected to never make mistakes when sending cryptos and to  keep their private keys perfectly safe and never forget their passwords  (if applicable). even exchanges that can afford to spend millions on  security & safety sometimes make mistakes, so how can average joe be  expected to do it better?   

imo, blockchains aren't safe. they rely on users being perfect, which is simply not the case.   

another problem is safe storage of paper wallets. how do you know  with certainty that nobody made a copy or took a picture, or keylogged  your password? the answer is: you can only hope. there are never  guarantees. blockchains do not solve this problem. look up how many btc  got lost and compare that to money that vanished in banks. does btc  really do better?

Isn't the halving at least partially priced in?,"Whenever my kids ask ""why does that thing cost that much"" we just work out way down the supply and demand narrative. If more people want it, it's worth more. If there are less available, it's worth more. Makes sense.

How do you predict Bitcoin's price?

Similar story, supply and demand. Lots of complex factors modify the demand: availability of fiat currencies, ease of on-ramping, simple and secure ways to hold, social reputation not only of BTC but also the exchanges, and, most significantly by far, clarity of information about the two fundamental features of bitcoin (immutable ownership and immutable supply limit). For my kids, simply, how many people want it, and how many are there.

I feel that this basic formula is applied to BTC's halvings too simplistically. Yes, the supply via mining will halve. But, that is not the full picture supply. The real supply us only minimally changed by halvings, it's those Bitcoin owners who want to buy things.

The ""true believers"" probably won't sell BTC for fiat, unless they're quickly buying something with it (surgery for a family member, a property, education costs, groceries, stocks). But there probably still is an ""overpriced"" value many would have some sense of. If someone was offering to buy BTC at $1m USD tomorrow, many of use would sell some BTC to benefit from that jump. Many would sell entire portfolios expecting it to dump by 90% sometime also.

My question is, if we know what % of supply mining counts for, and what % of people will never sell under any circumstances in the next decade, we can work out what % of an impact on the true supply thr halving will have.

Opinion: This is exactly where we will see if institutional shorting will play a role,"I'm not saying it will or won't happen. I'm not trying to say I have a crystal ball.

With an ETF and wall street + ease of access also comes an ease of access (relatively speaking) for these institutions to short bitcoin - if they were to decide to so. 

Fundamentally you may see shorting bitcoin to be a death sentence. Maybe it is. But we are yet to know if big money is going to go that direction. We are yet to see if all the bitcoin accumulated in this run is truly locked up. Or if it is an asset to be traded like anything else to them.

In my opinion, big money does like to play both sides of the market. If they play bitcoin in any similarity to how they play everything else, I wouldn't be surprised if institutional shorting plays a role in Bitcoin drawdowns.
On the flip side, more shorting = larger short squeezes and liquidations.

How this plays out, I have no idea. Just something in my mind as we flirt with ATH after a sizeable run.

My opinion - what happens next will determine the foundation of next year. Whether all this accumulation holds the market firm at a higher price, or if short term traders opt to sell, and the Market finds a lower fair value.
If all this accumulation is truly locked in. Skies the limit.

"Buying bitcoin with cash(USD) is similar to buying cash(USD) with another less valuble currency, like pesos.

Bitcoin's Relationship with USD and MXN (& other currencies),"
Lately, I've noticed a decline in the value of the US dollar against the Mexican peso, now hovering between 16.5 and 17.70 MXN, compared to the 20 to 23 MXN range of previous years. While this makes it cheaper to acquire dollars, it has also impacted the value of my Bitcoin investment, which is tied to the dollar. Although BTC has nearly reached $74,000, its value in MXN is now lower due to the strength of the Mexican peso. This situation leads me to question whether Bitcoin will decouple from the dollar in the future. Additionally, the possibility of Middle Eastern countries ceasing to use the dollar to trade oil could further weaken the dollar, affecting non-dollarized countries like Mexico. In this context, the strength of the Mexican peso could diminish the incentive to hold BTC, as even if its value in dollars reaches $100,000, if the dollar falls to 12 MXN, the value in pesos would be the same as before.",Bitcoin,https://reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1bh1izf/bitcoins_relationship_with_usd_and_mxn_other/,2024-03-17 12:19:28,-0.0446969696969697,0.20833333333333331,0.027,0.138,0.9517

"It's that period in the bitcoin cycle when those who pursued econ and philosophy are cool, for a while.","TL;DR: This post isn't about money.

For those seeking original opinions, here's mine for anyone interested. I've been around for a bit,  I understand the username is new. I've been reminded. I'm nobody special. 

This is a long, poorly written, rambling post, and a product of boredom and you should move on and enjoy your Sunday.

All you need to know: College, first time on a LAN, Napster, 17 years old. I pursued degrees in psyc, phil, and econ, despite constant reminders of their ""worthlessness"" unless I ventured into finance or chose a STEM field. Instead, I worked in seedy bars, indulged in Bukowski, traveled on tips, went to punk shows and embraced ""hipster"" culture. 

When the 2008 financial crisis hit, I logically moved into IT project and program management, and marketing (refer to ""Office Space,"" 1999, for a summary of the following 15 years).

As macroeconomic theory becomes trendy again, I too am hoping to exit the trenches of corporate America. Frankly, I'm less concerned with bitcoin's price now and more interested in pursuing things that matter more to me.

Parting advice: Read widely (I've recommended books in previous posts). Don't be afraid to think outside the box, as the Austrian economists did. 

For those curious about understanding bitcoin/blockchain beyond the basics, I suggest Peter McCormack on YouTube. His work resonated with me, seeing others with similar backgrounds engaging thoughtfully with these topics. There was a long drought, I had trouble finding good content, so cheers to that McCormack guy. 

Lyn Alden is another person who I think has extremely valuable insights. This sub seems to be on board with her already. Lasly, use tools! Use AI, use every tool at your disposal to learn. I ran this post through ChatGPT to help with grammar and legibility (I need plenty of help). We're not all technical writers, that's ok, use.all.the.tools.  

And if someone wants to discuss economic principles, or macro theory as it relates to digital assets, real-politics, or what have you, make sure to ask them to easily define the study of economics first. From personal experience, it is amazing how few people can give a basic, competent definition of what the hell the study of econ is. Dont with those people, it's death by 1000 cuts. Same thing goes for books. If someone wants to talk about a book or author that is controversial, for any reason, and they havent read the book, then their option of that book is fuck-all. It does not matter how they feel about the work or the author, and the fact that they want to share an opinion about something they haven't read tells you everything you need to know, and fast. Run from these people. They could not be more irrelevant. Fuck, run from anyone who tries to ban books in general (those people are relevant and very dangerous). 

Fuck Ayn Rand but the passage written about the nature of money in Atlas Shrugged is worth a second look, and I dont care what other flaws are present in her work, I dont need to agree with any or all of it, but it'd be dumb to discount the whole thing because... actually, no ,i dont know why people do stuff like that. It's dumb.

I think a lot of us Oregon Trail kids were forgotten for a while, doing the family raising thing, maybe some of us are back to do important things with folks on both sides of our generational divide, and help make sense of what is happening in the world around us. I think GenX, millennial, and Z have much more in common that many other sets of 3 generations in American history (Stowe & Howe, another recommendation)

If you're losing interest, this might be a good place to stop reading, it doesn't get better.

I'm interested in the concept of collective consciousness manifesting through what we call signs. Individuals can create scenarios that increase the likelihood of certain outcomes. For example, altering your route home to pass by someone you're interested in could lead to a serendipitous meeting and a shared future. This concept, I believe, is applicable to the broader impact of blockchain/bitcoin, which has moved beyond proof of concept. More people are beginning to grasp its potential. 

I do think this is one of the most exciting macro economic advancements of all time, I look on in awe, and it's been tough to find like minded people outside of niche internet places.

I'm now focusing on the impact of true resource ownership on art. I am not talking about NFT or token art, I'm talking about how this economic principle is going to affect real sentiment in the physical world. I love to discuss how Postmodernism has a relationship with our closely held beliefs about ourselves and what is ours, and what is us, and where is that line? Another interesting thing worthy of further exploration: The question remains: what is the oppressive ""elephant in the room"" that diminishes our time, soul, and humanity? While many references exist, like the ""Orange Pill,"" I believe these ideas also warrant further exploration. I'd rather engage in meaningful discussions than endure mundane corporate life. No Christina from account, I do not want your homemade cheesecake, it is 9AM. No more.

Having gained confidence and stability, I'm ready to explore these themes further. I don't need wealth; I aim for a fulfilling life without compromising my soul. As bitcoin grows, I understand its significance beyond financial terms. It opens discussions on human interactions, value, and existence in a world influenced by true ownership of your own mind (crazy right?).

If it matters to you that I've been around for a while, take this as you will, it's the best proof I'm willing to provide, it feels as if it were a lifetime ago, the good kids are the weird ones: [https://www.reddit.com/r/baltimore/comments/1z7fix/dogecoin\_meetup\_in\_baltimore/](https://www.reddit.com/r/baltimore/comments/1z7fix/dogecoin_meetup_in_baltimore/)

My insight on bitcoin's price should be met with critical thinking and skepticism. I dont day-trade. I dont do finance stuff. I do keep up on geopolitics, marco economics, and existentialism. My strategy is based on observation on world econ, the idea that Wall Street's manipulation through ETFs and OTC markets will continue until it can't due to bitcoin's limited supply. Markets, like people, can act irrationally individually but show order in large numbers. Bitcoin, much more protected from corruption by design, promises the hope of a more rational future. I believe its price will significantly increase in the next X months, probably sooner. This is not some kind of secret. The secret is that our system has made everyone so fucking doubful of what is right in front of them that they can no longer confidently distinguish what is real and what is noise.

Will it really keep going up? ,"What do you think about this? 
One side: BTC will become more scarce, fiat currency becomes debased, supply increases exponentially so the price of btc = supply of fiat$/supply of btc -> results in increase of btc price as fiat supply increases.

All good and well, but what about this? 
- Mining companies have gone down 90% so no real impact from it being more expensive to mine 
- current BTC circulating has no real use except trading, and most of btc has already been mined so the future halvings will not change much 
- Decentralization does not work, too expensive and inefficient
- No business takes crypto because of its volatility (will it ever even settle at a stable price?)

Seeking guidance on where Bitcoin protocol discussions take place,"Hello Bitcoin community!

I've been a part of the Bitcoin ecosystem for some time now, closely following its development and the various discussions surrounding its future. One thing that's been on my mind lately is the process of protocol upgrades and how the community navigates these changes, especially given the challenges of reaching consensus in such a decentralized environment.

I'm aware that major protocol discussions and decisions don't happen on Reddit, and I'm keen to dive deeper into where these critical conversations take place. I understand that Bitcoin's development process is both intricate and nuanced, involving a wide array of contributors from different backgrounds.

Could anyone here guide me on where I should look to find these discussions? Specifically, I'm interested in platforms or channels where developers and contributors discuss potential upgrades, security enhancements, and other protocol-related topics. I've heard of the Bitcoin Dev mailing list and Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) but would love to get more insights into how I can access these resources and possibly contribute to or learn from the discussions.

Additionally, if there are key conferences, workshops, or forums that serve as important venues for these debates, I'd appreciate recommendations on how to stay informed about them.

"The Recent Dip, and a Fairytale","Once upon a time, in the kingdom of CryptoLand, there lived a humble peasant named Jack. Jack was a dreamer, always eager to embark on new adventures, especially in the realm of digital currencies. One day, he heard whispers of a magical coin called Bitcoin that promised riches beyond imagination.

Driven by curiosity and the allure of wealth, Jack set off on a quest to acquire Bitcoin. With his meager savings, he purchased his first few coins. But alas! As soon as he made his purchase, the price of Bitcoin plummeted, leaving poor Jack in dismay.

Undeterred by his misfortune, Jack decided to try again. He worked tirelessly, saving every coin he could spare, until he had enough to buy even more Bitcoin. Excitedly, he made his purchase, only to watch in horror as the price once again dropped like a stone.

Feeling defeated but not defeated, Jack sought the advice of the wise old wizard of CryptoLand. The wizard, with a twinkle in his eye, revealed a secret to Jack. ""Ah, my dear lad,"" the wizard said, ""it seems you have a magical touch indeed. Every time you purchase Bitcoin, it dips in price.""

Jack was stunned. ""But how can this be?"" he exclaimed.

The wizard chuckled. ""It appears that the universe has a sense of humor, my friend. But fear not! Embrace your unique gift, for with great dips come great opportunities.""

And so, Jack embraced his fate as the unwitting bringer of Bitcoin dips. Instead of despairing, he used his power for good, waiting patiently for each dip to snatch up even more Bitcoin at bargain prices.

As time passed, Jack's legend grew throughout CryptoLand. He became known as ""Jack the Dipper,"" a folk hero celebrated for his uncanny ability to turn every Bitcoin dip into a golden opportunity. And they all lived happily ever after, hodling Bitcoin and laughing all the way to the moon.

At  this point I'm not going to sell all my sats to rebuy them in a nonKYC  exchange. While that would be the best solution, I'm still a bit  confused on how being taxed with my sats works and don't want to mess  around with selling.

What I'm  thinking is going Trezor to Sparrow wallet then coinjoin to cold card,  but my big question is once I do that I would no longer be able to sell  back on the KYC exchanges, right? I'm guessing I could only sell them on  Bisq?

I've also heard that using a  mixer could and might screw up the legitimacy of my sats since they are  KYC and that it's a bad idea to do this. Is this true or just FUD?

Finally,  how much privacy does this really grant me? I'm really not looking to  avoid paying taxes. In fact I'd be curious how getting taxed on sats  works as I have a number in mind for when the Bitty's hit to sell off  some to pay off my house, but need to know how much I'm going to get  taxed to make sure that's the right number in mind.

Is @satoshinakamoto instagram Real account of Satoshi Nakamoto? ,"Recently, this ig account popped up claiming to be Satoshi Nakamoto. It's only ""evidence"" is that he has the tick (verified profile). And now he claims that he activated some 50 Btc ""Satoshi-era"" wallet that was inactive for almost 14 years. The whole account is saying how it will ""expose this system soon"" all the time. I'm very sceptical about this profile, however my main question is: How can Satoshi Nakamoto prove his identity so we can be certain it is actually him? What would be that verification? Are those ""locked"" 1M ""satoshi's"" BTC's on one adress or is it just speculation on how many total Btc does he have maybe across multiple adresses? Can he add a note to on-chain transaction (something like ""I'm the Satoshi, the @satoshinakamoto ig is my real account"") from that 1M wallet?

Help me accomplish a dream? ,"To reddit Bitcoiners, I would like some help accomplishing my dream. I've been a dedicated Bitcoiner since 2018 and consider myself an advanced hardware and software wallet user. 

Ben from BTC Sessions is building a company called Bitcoin Mentors where they're hiring people to do 1 on 1 consultations training people on how to store their Bitcoin and best security practices. I am in the final interview round, and I really want the job. I've been trying to get a Bitcoin job for several years now and this is honestly my dream job. 

I've been offering people on reddit 1 hour free consultations, in exchange for a review I can use in my interview if you find my advice helpful. I've helped a couple other people clarify some gaps in their setup and knowledge, and would like to do the same for you if you want. 

There are a lot of scammers who will try to take your Bitcoin. I will not ask for your seed phrase (your 12/24 words that control your Bitcoin), I won't ask for money, or to even see your face or know your name. I only want to help, and selfishly I really want this Bitcoin job and so a review would be much appreciated. The interview is next Saturday, and I work 9-5 mon-fri at my current job, and so I'm really only available today for the next several hours. I can squeeze in some time after my job next week, but it gets a bit tight. 

You can see the reddit history on my account, as well as it's tenure. I am active as an advisor for some plants I grow that are pretty niche, as well as bitcoiners.

Is it possible to completely trust bitcoin?? ,"I was speaking with a friend, and he made good points that it’s hard to 100% trust bitcoin until we know more about Bitcoin’s origins, Satoshi Nakamoto, and the original Satoshi bitcoin wallets 

Obviously, it’s beneficial to bitcoin that the bitcoin creator remains anonymous. 

But at the same time, my friend is convinced that the bitcoin code is too perfect, and creating bitcoin would have been too difficult for an individual or smaller group of people. 

He has me worried that some sort of government or large tech company created bitcoin for possibly some sort of nefarious purpose we don’t quite understand yet 

Is anyone else worried about any possible Satoshi identities that are less than ideal? 

I just don’t want us to fall into the clutches of some government or mega cap company if the bitcoins from one of the original Satoshi wallets start to move.

I lurk here, and it feels like I'm in an echo chamber where everyone seems exuberant about BTC. Dissenting or bearish comments are absent, and the conversation is not balanced... but, if I research elsewhere, it feels like the author or vlogger, is also ideologically pro or con BTC. 

It's really hard to find a point of view that is measured and can consistently highlight the merits of both bear/bull positions.

Don't get me wrong, I am optimistic for BTC. It's just painful trying to sort through the noise to find objective information. How the hell do I find good info that's not blindly pro or con?

Bank Gave Me a Last Warning ,"So I tried to make a debit transaction to a crypto exchange. I had a $15,000 credit line and only tried to withdraw/buy about $5,000cad . The debit card was blocked. After calling, my online account got locked.

I went to the bank, stood an hour because they thought I was suspicious. They told me they don't give credit lines for crypto-currencies.

And the guy who approved my credit line said he was disappointed and didn't expect me to gamble, it's not for my ""education"", even though I wasn't approved for a student credit line because it's a private type of training and I have to pay regular interest with no student benefit. I work part-time, which is enough to repay whatever I take from my line. 

So I got a personal line of credit, not knowing that I had restrictions. The branch director came and told me I didn't deserve that kind of credit line and that they didn't allow cryptocurrency transactions. And I’m only allowed to buy from my earned savings, I've probably ruined my record at one of Canada's largest banks. They will probably reduce my limit.
It’s not like I missed any payment in my life anywhere.

It all happened in the line, in front of everyone.

Edit: Thanks to everyone who replied. 

I don't encourage debt. I took the risk I had personally calculated. Honestly, it's not much - I still have to spend 7 times as much on my continuing training. And I've learned a thing or two in the last five hours.
